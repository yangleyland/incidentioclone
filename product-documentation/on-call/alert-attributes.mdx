title: Alert attributes
description: Turn alert data into critical context for responders to power routing, escalations, and automation.
---

Alerts from different sources (observability platforms, error tracking tools, ticketing platforms and more) arrive with inconsistent formats and field names. Alert attributes create a consistent language to describe alerts regardless of source.

These standardized attributes enable [alert routing](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) to automatically page the right teams based on alert context. Attributes are fields extracted from JSON payloads like:

| Attribute | Example attribute value |
|-----------|------------------------|
| <Badge color="purple">Team</Badge> | Product development |
| <Badge color="yellow">Service</Badge> | Payments |
| <Badge color="red">Customer</Badge> | Acme Corp |
| `Priority` | P1 |

Attributes also provide visibility for on-call responders, power workflows, and enable insights into alert patterns and quality over time.

Define attributes in **Settings → Alerts → Attributes** and configure attribute extraction when setting up new [alert sources](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-sources).

## What attributes enable

**Alert routing**
- Automatically page the right teams based on the alert context. Configure [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) to use attributes for dynamic routing.
- For example, route alerts to the team owning the affected service.

**Populate incident custom fields**
- Automatically set incident custom fields from alert attributes.
- For example, when multiple alerts are grouped into one incident, the incident's affected <Badge color="purple">Teams</Badge> custom field can aggregate all team attributes from those alerts and show which teams were impacted.
- This enables better insights and reporting on incidents.

**Trigger workflows**
- Drive automations based on alert context using attributes in [workflow](/product-documentation/workflows/overview) conditions.
- For example, use impacted <Badge color="red">Customer</Badge> attribute to automatically add the account's Customer success manager to incidents.
- Another example, use the <Badge color="blue">Github user</Badge> attribute to page the engineer who last worked on this area.

**Learn from insights**
- Aggregate and analyse alerts across different sources and identify patterns.
- Catalog-powered attributes allow for more granular insights than plain text attributes.
- For example, use feature attribute to analyze which product areas generate the most alerts, helping prioritize reliability work.

**Send to the right channels**
- Route alerts to specific Slack or Microsoft Teams channels dynamically based on context.
- For example, use <Badge color="purple">Team</Badge> attribute to send alerts to the right team channel.

## Define attributes

Set up attributes once, use them everywhere. Define which fields matter for your organization:

1. Using the sidebar, navigate to **Settings → Alerts**
2. Click the **Settings icon** (gear icon in top right)
3. Select **Attributes**
4. Click **+ Add attribute** to create a new attribute (see [recommended attributes](#recommended-attributes) below)
5. Configure the fields:
   - **Name**: What to call the attribute (e.g., Team, Service, Customer)
   - **Resource type**: Link to Catalog types or store as plain text (String)
   - **Multi-value**: Allow multiple values per alert
   - **Required**: Mark as required when this attribute is critical for routing and escalation
6. Click **Save changes**

**String (text) attributes** store freeform data like error messages or URLs. **Catalog-powered attributes** link to your organizational structure and enable dynamic routing.

<Tip>
To use Catalog-powered attributes, set up your [Catalog](/product-documentation/catalog) first.

### Recommended attributes

Start with these commonly used attributes to enable powerful routing and automation:

| Recommended attribute | Common uses |
|----------------------|------|
| <Badge color="purple">Team</Badge> | Routes alerts to the right team automatically, tracks which teams are affected across grouped alerts |
| <Badge color="yellow">Service</Badge> | Groups alerts by service for routing and insights, helps identify which services generate the most alerts |
| <Badge color="blue">Feature</Badge> | Groups alerts by product area, especially useful for insights and analysis, can trigger automations (e.g., update status page for feature outages) |
| <Badge color="red">Customer</Badge> | Triggers customer-specific workflows, for example automatically add the account's CSM to incidents |
| `Labels` | Catch-all for key-value pairs from alert sources, avoids creating 15+ individual attributes for every piece of metadata |

### Labels

Labels bundle multiple key-value pairs without requiring individual attribute setup. Alert sources like Grafana, Datadog, and Sentry send lots of metadata (`resource_type`, `cluster`, `namespace`, `environment`) as labels. Instead of creating a separate attribute for each, use labels to pull through all key-value pairs automatically.

This lets teams add new labels to their monitoring tools without additional configuring anything in incident.io. Labels appear automatically on alerts for debugging and context.

For example, a Grafana alert might include labels as a single alert attribute with information like:
- `cluster: us-east-1`
- `namespace: production`
- `resource_type: pod`
- `severity: critical`

### Required attributes

Mark attributes like <Badge color="purple">Team</Badge> as `Required` to ensure all alerts include critical fields. When required attributes are missing, incident.io notifies admins via email or Slack—helping you catch configuration issues before they break routing.

For example, if your alert routing depends on the team attribute and it's missing, admins are notified immediately to fix the upstream configuration.

<Tip>
Only mark attributes as required when every alert is expected to include that value.

## Extract attributes from sources

Extract attribute values from alert payloads when setting up and configuring [alert sources](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-sources). Use AI recommendations, or use custom logic to extract specific attributes.

### Extract using AI

AI analyzes your alert payload and automatically suggests which attributes to extract, matching fields like <Badge color="purple">Team</Badge>, <Badge color="yellow">Service</Badge>, or <Badge color="red">Customer</Badge> to your defined attributes and existing Catalog entries.

**To use AI-powered extraction:**

1. Follow the [alert source setup](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-sources) steps and navigate to the final stage **Configure your setup**
2. Click **Review attributes** to see AI suggestions based on your payload
3. For each suggested attribute:
   - Click **Accept** to add the attribute extraction (e.g., parse Team from payload)
   - Click **Skip** to ignore the suggestion
4. Accepted attributes appear in **Your attributes** section

### Extract with custom logic

Extract specific attributes from alerts or transform values when you need custom logic.

**To link an existing attribute from the alert source payload:**

1. In the Attributes section during source setup, click **+ Add**
2. Select **Link an existing attribute** and choose an attribute from your catalog
3. The attribute automatically maps to matching fields in your payload

**To create custom extraction with JavaScript:**

1. In the Attributes section during source setup, click **+ Add**
2. Select **Create a new attribute** and enter the attribute name (e.g., Team slack channel)
4. Write JavaScript (ES5) expression to extract the value from your payload
5. Configure the result type (String, Customer, Business functionality, etc.)

**Common custom extraction scenarios:**

**Extract from nested arrays**

When a monitoring tool sends data in arrays, filter to find the specific value you need:

```javascript
// Extracts feature name from tags like ["feature:payments", "env:prod"]
$.metadata.tags.filter(function(tag) {
  return tag.startsWith("feature:")
})
```

**Add fallback values**

When different alert sources use different field names, add fallbacks to ensure the attribute always gets populated:

```javascript
// Try multiple possible locations for team name
$.metadata.team || $.labels.team || "unknown"
```

This tries `$.metadata.team` first, then `$.labels.team` if that's empty, and finally defaults to "unknown" if neither exists.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why are my attributes missing?">
    When alerts arrive without expected attribute values, click **Inspect** on any alert to view the original payload, JavaScript expressions, and extraction results.

    Common causes:
    - **Inconsistent payloads**: Your monitoring tool sends different data structures for different alert types. Add fallback expressions using `||` (e.g., `$.metadata.team || $.labels.team`)
    - **Missing Catalog entries**: For Catalog-powered attributes, text values from your payload must match Catalog entries. Use **External IDs** as your system's canonical identifier or add **Aliases** for naming variations. For example, a team called "Payments" might have aliases "payments", "paymnts", and "billing-team" so alerts from different monitoring tools all map to the same Catalog entry.

    Edit attribute expressions in your alert source to add fallbacks or adjust extraction logic.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I set up and map priorities?">
    Create priorities based on alert severity in **Settings → Alerts → Priorities**. Define priority levels like `P1`, `P2`, `P3` that correspond to severity values from your monitoring tools. Use these priorities in [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) and [escalation paths](/product-documentation/on-call/escalation-paths) to control escalation behavior.

    For example, route `P1` alerts directly to senior engineers while `P2` alerts follow standard escalation.

    **Map incoming severities to priorities:**

    Navigate to **Settings → Alerts → Priorities**, edit a priority, and add aliases to map incoming alert severities:
    - **P1**: Add aliases "critical", "error", "urgent"
    - **P2**: Add aliases "high", "major"
    - **P3**: Add aliases "medium", "warning"

    Note: Priority matching is case-sensitive, so "High" and "high" are different.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between String and Catalog attributes?">
    **String (text) attributes** store freeform data like error messages, URLs, or environment names. Use these when you don't need to link the value to other parts of incident.io.

    **Catalog-powered attributes** link to your organizational structure (teams, services, etc.) and enable dynamic routing. When you set an attribute like <Badge color="purple">Team</Badge> to a Catalog type, you can use expressions like `alert.team.escalation_path` to automatically page the correct team.

    Choose Catalog attributes when you need to route alerts or connect to escalation paths. Choose String attributes for context that doesn't need automation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When should I use aliases vs External IDs?">
    **External IDs** are your system's canonical identifier—immutable and unique. Set these first as the "source of truth" for each Catalog entry.

    **Aliases** handle naming variations. Add multiple aliases to match different ways your monitoring tools refer to the same thing. For example, a team might have External ID `platform-team` but aliases "platform", "platform-eng", "Platform Engineering".

    Use both together: External IDs keep things organized internally, while aliases make sure alerts from different tools all match the same Catalog entry.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Where can I see attributes?">
    Alert attributes appear across incident.io to give responders context:
    - **Alerts table** (**On-call** → **Alerts**) - Scan attributes across multiple alerts
    - **Alert sidebar** - Click any alert to see all attributes, or click **Inspect** to view raw JSON
    - **Mobile app, SMS, voice** - Critical context when being paged via [mobile app](/product-documentation/on-call/mobile-app-push-notifications), [SMS, or voice calls](/product-documentation/on-call/sms-and-voice)
    - **Incident channels** - View alert attributes as incident context
