title: Live call routing
description: Route incoming phone calls to the right on-call teams.
---

Live call routing connects incoming phone calls to on-call teams, ensuring critical issues reach the right person without manual coordination.

Use live call routing to provide external stakeholders, customers, or monitoring systems with a single phone number that always reaches your on-call team. Configure call routing rules to match your schedules and escalation logic.

Using the sidebar, navigate to **Settings → Call routes**. Click **Request number** to request a new phone number and configure routing.

## Manage phone numbers

Request new phone numbers with incident.io or bring your own existing phone numbers, for supported regions.

**Supported regions for call routing numbers:**

| Region | Country Code |
|--------|--------------|
| United States | +1 |
| United Kingdom | +44 |
| Netherlands | +31 |
| Israel | +972 |

<Tip>
Request numbers for different countries through support within the platform, or by [contacting support](mailto:support@incident.io).
</Tip>

Live call routing numbers may function for end users in neighboring countries depending on carrier and regional telecom coverage.

Control who can call each number and use custom prompts to reduce accidental calls and provide callers with context about who they are contacting.

- **Anyone can call** - No restrictions, calls route immediately to your team
- **Require caller confirmation** - Type a custom message to be played to callers (e.g., "Press 1 to reach our on-call engineering team"), then require them to press '1' to connect
- **Specific phone numbers only** - Restrict access to an allowlist of approved phone numbers

## Configure routing rules

Assign each phone number to a routing rule. Each routing rule defines escalation levels - you choose which schedules or users to notify at each level.

- On each level, incident.io tries calling each person for 30 seconds.
- If they don't pick up, it tries the next person.
- Once everyone on level 1 has been tried, the system moves to level 2, continuing until all levels are exhausted.

Add multiple levels to ensure calls eventually reach someone.

## Supported languages

Choose the language for automated voice responses when handling inbound calls. Currently supported languages include:
- English
- French
- German
- Portuguese (Brazilian)
- Portuguese (Portugal)

[Contact support](mailto:support@incident.io) to request languages not listed above. The selected language applies to caller confirmation prompts and system messages.

## Alert routing for calls

Incoming calls create alerts that can be routed using [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing). Create alert routes for the **Incoming calls** alert source to:
- Create incidents automatically when calls come in
- Send call notifications to Slack or Microsoft Teams channels
- Group calls into incidents based on attributes
- Filter which calls trigger incidents based on conditions

Use alert routing to go beyond basic call connection and integrate calls into your broader incident response workflow.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What does my customer see when calling me?">
    Your customer only sees the phone number incident.io purchases on your behalf. If you have specific requirements for this number (e.g. a specific country or area code, a toll-free number), [contact support](mailto:support@incident.io) when requesting a number.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What will I see when I am being connected to a call?">
    Calls routed to responders will come from your live call routing number. Add this number to your phone's do-not-disturb bypass settings to ensure you receive calls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there an extra charge for live call routing?">
    See the [pricing page](https://incident.io/pricing) for details on how many numbers are included on each plan. Anyone on a call route needs an On-call seat. Contact your customer success manager if you require more numbers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if no one answers the call?">
    The system waits 30 seconds for each person to answer before trying the next person on that level. Once everyone on a level has been tried, it moves to the next level. If no one at any level answers, the call ends.
