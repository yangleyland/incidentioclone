# Widget API and embedding

The widget API lets you embed real-time status information directly into your product or website. Instead of directing users to a separate status page, show component health, active incidents, and uptime data wherever users need it—from your app header to your login page.

## Use cases

**Common embedding scenarios:**
- Display component status badges in your app header
- Show active incidents on your login page during outages
- Embed incident history in your support portal
- Build custom status dashboards using status data
- Integrate status into internal tools and monitoring systems

The widget updates in real-time as incidents are published or updated, ensuring users always see current information.

## Setting up the widget API

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access widget settings">
    Navigate to **Settings** → **Widget API** in your status page configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate credentials">
    Generate an API key or embed code depending on your implementation approach:
    - **Embed code** - Pre-built JavaScript widget for quick integration
    - **API key** - Direct API access for custom implementations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add to your site">
    Add the generated code to your website or product. The widget automatically fetches and displays status data.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Style the widget">
    Customize the widget appearance to match your design system. The widget accepts CSS styling and configuration options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Implementation approaches

### JavaScript embed widget

Use the pre-built embed widget for quick integration:

```html
<script src="https://widget.incident.io/status.js"></script>
<div data-incident-status="your-status-page-id"></div>
```

The embed widget provides:
- Component status badges
- Active incident count
- Recent incident feed
- Automatic updates

### API integration

Use the API directly for custom implementations:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.incident.io/v1/status_pages/your-page-id', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // Build custom UI with status data
});
```

The API returns:
- Current component statuses
- Active incidents
- Historical incident data
- Uptime metrics

## Widget capabilities

**What you can display:**
- **Component status badges** - Show operational, degraded, or outage states for specific components
- **Active incident count** - Display number of ongoing incidents
- **Incident feed** - Show recent or active incidents with details
- **Uptime percentages** - Display component reliability metrics
- **Maintenance windows** - Show scheduled maintenance

**Update frequency:**
- Widgets poll for updates every 60 seconds by default
- Configurable polling interval
- Supports webhooks for instant updates (API integration only)

## Customization

The widget accepts configuration options for appearance and behavior:

**Display options:**
- Show/hide specific components
- Filter by incident severity
- Control update frequency
- Choose light or dark theme
- Set custom CSS classes

**Example configuration:**
```javascript
{
  components: ['api', 'dashboard'],
  theme: 'dark',
  pollInterval: 30,
  showUptime: true
}
```

## Security considerations

**API key access:**
- API keys are read-only and scoped to your status page
- Keys can be rotated anytime from Settings → Widget API
- Use separate keys for different environments (staging, production)

**CORS restrictions:**
- Configure allowed domains in Settings → Widget API
- Widgets only load from approved domains
- Prevents unauthorized embedding

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I embed the widget on multiple sites?">
    Yes. Generate one API key and use it across multiple sites. Configure allowed domains in Settings → Widget API to control where the widget can load.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the widget work with SPAs and modern frameworks?">
    Yes. The widget API works with React, Vue, Angular, and other JavaScript frameworks. Use the API integration approach for full control over rendering.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often does the widget update?">
    The default polling interval is 60 seconds. You can configure this down to 10 seconds or use webhooks for instant updates with API integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I style the widget to match my site?">
    Yes. The embed widget accepts custom CSS classes and supports light/dark themes. For complete control, use the API integration and build your own UI.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a rate limit on API requests?">
    Yes. Widget API requests are rate limited to 60 requests per minute per API key. This is sufficient for typical polling intervals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I show historical data with the widget?">
    Yes. The API returns historical incident data. You can build custom views showing incident history, uptime trends, and past maintenance windows.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does the widget support Intercom integration?">
    Yes, but Intercom has a dedicated integration separate from the widget API. See [Subscriptions and communication](/product-documentation/status-pages/subscriptions-and-communication) for Intercom setup.
