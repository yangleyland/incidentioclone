Our [pricing](https://incident.io/pricing) is based on the number of Response and On-call seats in your company. Here's what you get with each seat type.

## Seat types at a glance

incident.io has three seat types:

- **Viewer seats** (free) - Unlimited seats for everyone who needs to declare incidents and contribute during response
- **Response seats** (paid) - For people actively managing incidents: changing status, posting updates, assigning roles, and writing post-mortems
- **On-call seats** (paid) - For people who need to be paged, with access to schedules, mobile notifications, and escalation paths

You can combine Response and On-call seats for users who need both capabilities.

**Note:** A checkmark (✓) means this capability is available for that seat type. We have roles and permissions to further configure or restrict what users can do. Some capabilities are only available on paid plans.
