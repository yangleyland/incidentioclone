Our pricing is based on the number of Response and On-call seats you use. You can choose monthly or annual billing depending on your plan.

## Billing frequency

- **Team Plan:** Choose monthly or annual billing
- **Pro and Enterprise Plans:** Annual billing only

## Monthly billing

Available for Team Plans only.

We charge you at the start of each month based on your current active seats. On subsequent months, we adjust for any changes:
- If you added seats during the month, we charge for the overage (prorated daily)
- If you removed seats, we credit your account (prorated daily)

Your billing date stays the same each month.

## Annual billing

### Team Plan

Pay upfront for 12 months based on the seats you're using when you sign up. We calculate any overages or downgrades throughout the year and settle up on your anniversary date.

### Pro and Enterprise Plans

Work with our sales team to estimate the seats you'll need for the year. We invoice you on your service start date.

If you need to add more seats during the year, you have two options:
- **Co-term contract**: Add seats at a reduced rate, extending to your renewal date
- **Annual true-up**: We bill you at the end of the year for additional seats (prorated daily)

## Seat limits

**Team Plan:** Add or remove seats freely - no limits

**Pro and Enterprise Plans:** Hard seat limits based on your contract. Contact our sales team if you need to increase your limit.

## Managing your billing

You can manage your billing information and view usage in [Settings > Billing](https://app.incident.io/settings/billing).

  <Accordion title="Do you have a W-9 or W8-BEN form?">
    We're a UK-based company so we use form a W8-BEN instead of a W-9. You can download that [here](https://help.incident.io/articles/1324106831-do-you-have-a-w-9-or-w8-ben-form%3F).
