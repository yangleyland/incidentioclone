## Deleting your organization

To delete your organization, contact [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io). You must be the organization owner or have appropriate admin permissions, and contact us from your registered account email address or Slack.

Provide your organization URL (e.g., `https://app.incident.io/your-org-name`). The support team will handle organization deletion and plan cancellation.

After deletion completes:
- You'll receive confirmation from support
- All users lose access to the organization
- Automated emails and notifications stop
- You can create a new account if you want to use incident.io again in the future

## Deleting your user account

Individual user accounts are synchronized with your Slack profile and cannot be deleted directly from incident.io. Organization owners or admins can downgrade your permissions to the Viewer role at **Settings → Users**, but complete account deletion requires deactivating a user's Slack profile.

Enterprise customers using SCIM can deprovision users through their identity provider.
