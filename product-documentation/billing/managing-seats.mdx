## Automatic seat assignment

We automatically graduate users to a Response seats when they take any response-related action (like changing an incident status or posting an update).

For On-call seats, we'll ask you to confirm before upgrading a user when you:
- Add them to a schedule
- Add them to an escalation path

## Removing seats

Users are only removed from Response or On-call seats if:
- You manually downgrade them in [Settings > Users ](https://app.incident.io/settings/users)
- Their Slack account is deleted

They won't lose their seat if they stop taking actions - you have to explicitly downgrade them.
