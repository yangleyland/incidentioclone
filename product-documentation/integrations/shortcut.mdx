## What we can do with Shortcut

Our current integration is a fairly simple setup for now. In its present state, the integration lets you:

- **Export** [**your incident to-dos**](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/5948204-keeping-track-of-who-s-doing-what) to Shortcut; and
- **Sync the status of your tasks between Shortcut and incident.io**, so you can work in Shortcut without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!

In the near future we'll be introducing all sorts of convenient tools to help you stay on top of your incident actions:

- Bulk exports
- Ways to prioritise incident actions and follow-ups
- Nudging for actions which haven't been completed
- Set SLAs depending on the urgency of the action
- ... [get in touch](http://incident.io/community) to give us your wishlist!
