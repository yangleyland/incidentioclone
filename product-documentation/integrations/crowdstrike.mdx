# Crowdstrike Falcon

Customers can seamlessly connect Falcon with incident.io to import crucial information. When an alert comes through Falcon, it enables incident.io to page the right person based on the customer's configuration, provide detailed information about the alert, and gather the necessary team members in the incident channel to collaborate on resolving the incident. Additionally, incident.io can automatically create incidents from alert sources and filter and group them according to the customer's preferences.

This article provides step by step instructions for setting up Crowdstrike Falcon as an alert source within incident.io.

## Instructions

1. Head over to the [Alerts](https://app.incident.io/~/alerts/sources) section in your incident.io dashboard and select the sources tab at the top of the page
