# Jira

[incident.io](http://incident.io/) integrates with Jira so you can colocate follow-ups of incidents with your teams' planned work.

---

## What we can do with Jira

There are 2 main features [incident.io](http://incident.io) support with Jira:

### Exporting follow-ups as Jira tickets

With Jira connected to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) you can export follow-ups via the web dashboard and our Slack/MS Teams apps. Information on the ticket such as its title, assignee, and completion is synced back to incident.io, updating the corresponding follow-up.

You can also configure this to have them **automatically exported** based on attributes of an incident. This ensures that tickets are created in the right Jira projects without incident responders having to think about it.

### Syncing incidents to Jira

When enabled, a Jira ticket will be created to represent each incident in Jira. We automatically sync the incident ticket when the incident is changed in incident.io.

Just like auto-exporting follow-ups, you are also able to configure exactly which Jira projects to create tickets in based on an incident's attributes.

If an incident has a Jira ticket associated with it, we will mark it as related to any exported follow-ups.

## Enabling multiple Jira sites

Depending on your billing plan, you may be able to enable multiple Jira sites to be used in [incident.io](http://incident.io), allowing [incident.io](http://incident.io) to create tickets in multiple Jira sites.

You can do this by clicking on the edit button next to the site name in the Jira integration settings page, where you will be able to enable more sites.

If you don't see the desired sites, make sure that you have installed the Atlassian Marketplace app in all sites you'd like to enable.
