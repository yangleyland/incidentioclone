# Backstage

We offer the ability to import Backstage catalog data into the incident.io Catalog, either by pulling entries directly from the Backstage API or by loading catalog-info.yaml files.

To learn more, **go to our** [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer/tree/master/docs/backstage) **and follow the steps outlined in the README.**
