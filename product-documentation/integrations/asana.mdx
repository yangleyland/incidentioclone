# Asana

Using Asana to track your team's tasks? Want to export [your incident follow-ups](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/5948204-keeping-track-of-who-s-doing-what) to Asana to keep everything centralised?

This is how.

## What we can do with Asana

Our current integration is a fairly simple setup for now. In its present state, the integration lets you:

- **Export [your incident follow-ups](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/5948204-keeping-track-of-who-s-doing-what) to Asana;** and
- **Sync the status of your tasks between Asana and incident.io**, so you can work in Asana without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!
- [**Auto-export follow-ups**](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/8447561-auto-exporting-follow-ups) to a Asana project, based on pre-configured rules
