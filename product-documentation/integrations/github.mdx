Are you using GitHub for version control, or to track your team's tasks?

You should consider installing our integration.

## What our GitHub integration can do

Our integration lets you:

### 1. Export your incident to-dos to GitHub

You can export your follow-ups to GitHub. We'll sync the status of your tasks, so you can work in GitHub without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!

You'll see the option to export your follow-ups from the incident homepage:

You can also create export templates and [**automatically export follow-ups**](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/8447561-auto-exporting-follow-ups).

### 2. Attach GitHub pull requests to incidents

When you drop a link to a GitHub PR in your incident channel, we'll ask if you want to add it as an [attachment](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/6601070-how-do-i-add-attachments-to-incidents). Once it's attached, we'll notify the channel about changes to that PR, for example if it gets merged.

That's it!
