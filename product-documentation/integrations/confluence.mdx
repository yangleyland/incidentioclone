3. Next, navigate to your Jira/Confluence site and click on "**Apps > Manage Apps**".

4. You should see the incident.io app in this page, click on the row to expand it, then click on the "**Get started**" button.

5. You will be navigated to a page with a "**Link an incident.io organisation**" button. Click on it and you will be navigated to the incident.io dashboard.

6. Within incident.io dashboard, verify the incident.io organisation that you'd like to connect to is correctly selected. Hit the "**Connect**" button.

## Getting started

### Add Confluence as your document destination for post-mortems

Within the [Post-Mortem setting tab](https://app.incident.io/settings/post-mortem), add Confluence as your document destination by clicking 'Add destination'.

You can then configure the default destination for your post-mortems - we'll then create post-mortems as children of the page you select. This will be the default destination for your post-mortems.

<Tip>
Can't see the page destination you are looking for? You can simply search the page name in the drop-down to find the right one!
</Tip>

### Creating custom post-mortem destinations for different teams or services

You can create different post-mortem destinations for different teams or services by adding further destinations.

When you go to create and export a post-mortem, you can choose the correct destination depending on the team or service. Your default post-mortem destination will be used if you don't select a different destination!
