<Note>
**A couple of notes**

*You will need a Slack admin to install us due to Slack's permissioning model.*

*The app uses `/inc` and `/incident` as slash commands. If you already have an app installed or install one after ours that uses either of these commands, then just note that Slack will default to using the most recently installed app when that command is run.*

## 1. Sign Up (via Slack)

From the [sign-up page](https://app.incident.io), you'll be asked to '*Sign in with Slack*'.

We'll create an account for you and store some basic information, like your name and avatar. We'll also ask for a restricted set of permissions in order for [incident.io](http://incident.io/) to work. Read more in our [Security FAQs](https://docs.incident.io/security-faqs).

## 2. Select your integrations

This is just so we get a sense of the most-used tools in our user base. We explain how to set up your integrations [here](https://help.incident.io/en/collections/3324010-api-integrations).

## 3. Add incident.io to Slack

Last step: '*Add incident.io to Slack*'.

When you've done this, we'll create you an #incidents channel, and install the incident.io app into your workspace.

...all done!

**Everyone in your Slack workspace can now use [incident.io](http://incident.io/)** — they simply need to go through the same '[Login with Slack](http://app.incident.io)' flow. They will not be asked to '*Add incident.io to Slack*' - that step only happens once.

Let's go declare some incidents!
