# Linear

Using Linear to track your team's tasks? Using Linear to *triage* your team's tasks?

This is how you can export [your incident to-dos](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/5948204-keeping-track-of-who-s-doing-what) to Linear to keep everything centralized, *and* automatically assign tasks according to your [incident schedules](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/8978989-building-schedules).

## What we can do with Linear

### Assign triage tickets automatically

If you use [On-call](https://incident.io/on-call) with incident.io, you can combine this with [Linear's Triage functionality](https://linear.app/docs/triage) to automatically action triage tasks to who is currently on call on your incident.io schedules.

### Exporting follow-ups

1. **Export [your incident follow-ups](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/7172472-follow-ups) to Linear;**

2. **Sync the status of your tasks between Linear and incident.io**, so you can work in Linear without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!

3. **Bulk Exports through the Follow-ups tab.**
