# GitLab

## What our GitLab integration can do

### 1. Export your incident follow-ups to GitLab

You can export your follow-ups to GitLab. We'll sync the status of your tasks, so you can work in GitLab without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!

<Note>
Use [auto-export follow-ups](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/8447561-auto-exporting-follow-ups) to make sure all your follow-up tasks are tracked in GitLab.
</Note>

You'll see the option to export your follow-ups from the incident homepage:

### 2. Link GitLab issues to your follow-ups

You can copy the reference of issues you already have and linked them back to your incident.io follow-ups.

### 3. Attach GitLab Merge Requests to incidents from Slack

You can attach GitLab MRs to your incident directly from the incident channel.

### 4. Attach GitLab MRs to incidents from GitLab

You can also attach an MR by mentioning the incident number in the MR title or source branch.

## Setting Up

Adding GitLab to incident.io is simple.

<Note>
You'll need a GitLab top-level group owner to perform some of these steps.
</Note>

### 1. Create a Service Account user in GitLab

Follow [GitLab's guide to creating a service account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/service_accounts.html#create-a-service-account). We recommend using 'incident.io' for the `name`, since this will show up in the UI on issues and comments created by the integration.

<Note>
Make sure the bot user has access to create and edit issues, and view and comment on merge requests in all relevant projects.
</Note>

We recommend assigning the `Reporter` role to your incident.io service account user.

See GitLab.com: [Permissions and roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)

### 2. Create a personal access token with no expiry

Follow [GitLab's guide here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-service-account-personal-access-token-with-no-expiry-date).

For **scopes**, pass `api`. For **name** use 'incident.io integration'.

Note the token value for the next step!

### 3. Connect the integration

Go to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations), click on GitLab, then Connect.

Paste in the access token created in step 2 and click **Connect**. That's it!

<Warning>
For GitLab users to connect with their incident.io accounts, their GitLab public email must:
- Match their incident.io user email
- Be visible on their GitLab profile

</Warning>

If you're using self-managed GitLab, make sure traffic from [our IPs](https://help.incident.io/articles/8242295180-allowlisting-ip-addresses-for-jira-server) can reach your instance.

### Next up

We recommend adding a Group Hook in GitLab, which allows us to sync changes in GitLab back to incident.io. Read our [setup guide here](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/9809180-setting-up-a-gitlab-group-hook).

If you run into any issues, [get in touch](https://incident.io/community).
