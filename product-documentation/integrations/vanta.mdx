# Vanta

You can integrate Vanta with your incident.io account!

Using Vanta's Connectors API you can connect your Vanta account to track any follow-ups matching the conditions you define as Security Tasks in Vanta.

## What can I do with this integration?

1. Auditing of users with access to your incident.io account, and of those with elevated privileges. This lets your Vanta auditor quickly and painlessly check that you're being careful with giving out admin/owner privileges, and provides evidence that leavers are locked out quickly.

2. Track follow-ups as 'security tasks' inside Vanta: this lets security teams have their incident follow-ups tracked in Vanta, so they can provide evidence that they're meeting any SLAs on them (e.g. 'we complete all security tasks within 2 weeks, in compliance with SOC II').

## How do I set this up?

1. Navigate to the [integrations settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations) within incident.io and click `Install` next to the Vanta option. We'll bounce you straight to Vanta's app and ask you to accept the security policies.

2. Add conditions to incidents that should have their follow-ups tracked in Vanta.

It's as easy as that!
