# Zoom

Having responders create a Zoom meeting whenever they start an incident is best practice, but it's also easily forgotten and not very scalable...

We can take on that work for you! We'll **automatically generate and surface an individual call URL when an incident is declared**, so you have a dedicated 'war room' for every incident.

---

# Installation

You can add Zoom to incident.io and configure auto create in just a few clicks.

### 1. Go to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations)

### 2. Click 'Connect' on the Zoom Integration

### 3. Log in using a service account

Clicking 'Connect' will take you to the Zoom Marketplace, where you'll be asked to sign-in and install the app by accepting the permissions.

To access our full range of incident calls features, you'll need to install with an account that has role permissions to view users, and check the box "Allow this app to use my shared access permissions".

Make sure to create/sign-in with a **[service account](https://help.incident.io/en/articles/5963467-which-zoom-account-should-we-use-for-incident-io)**!

On the following screen you will be able to see which permissions our app requests.

<img src="/images/integrations/zoom/zoom-permissions.png" alt="Zoom permissions screen" />

Be sure to tick the option to allow shared access permissions at the bottom.

Without this, features such as Scribe will not work correctly and we will not be able to call participant information to display which users are currently on the call.

After authorising the app, you'll be redirected back to the integrations page where Zoom should show as connected.

### 4. Enable auto create

With Zoom installed, you can now configure it to automatically create video calls for your incidents.

### 5. All set!

You're good to go.

# Automatically creating calls

With this configuration applied, incident.io will create a Zoom meeting whenever an incident is declared.

- The meeting link will be set to the incident's Call URL, display in the dashboard and anywhere the incident is mentioned.
- We'll also message about the Zoom meeting in the incident channel, with an easy "Join Call" button.

If you need help with this, [get in touch](http://incident.io/community)!

# Permissions

Installing Zoom will authorise incident.io to:

- **View and manage meetings**: so we can create meetings in this users name
- **View and manage recordings**: so we can automatically record these meetings (should it be requested)
- **View user information**: to help us identify the Zoom user and link them to their Slack identity for debugging of the integration
- **View user settings**: to read password requirement settings

Additionally, ensure that your settings in the Zoom workspace allows users to request local recordings, this will allow Scribe to starting transcribing the call.

# Connecting multiple accounts

Zoom allows only a single access token per app, per user. This means that once you connect incident.io to Zoom, any previously issued access token for that app and user is invalidated. This means that if (for example) you have a production account connected to to Zoom, and you then connect the same Zoom user to your sandbox account, that the production account will be disconnected from Zoom.

This behaviour from Zoom aligns with OAuth 2.0 best practices to ensure secure access control and prevent simultaneous sessions with multiple tokens.

# FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which Zoom account should we use for incident.io?">
    We recommend using a **service account**.

    Why? Whoever we authorise against will be assigned as the Zoom meeting 'host', so if you use one of your team members's account:

    - It might be confusing to imply a human created the meeting rather than a Zoom account called "incident.io bot", for example;
    - It will also always be the same human, which might add to the confusion;
    - That team member's calendar will virtually explode;
    - You could lose access to the Zoom integration if the individual leaves.

    If you're struggling with the Zoom integration, [get in touch](http://incident.io/community)!

  <Accordion title="Can we uninstall Zoom?">
    Of course!

    Should you wish to uninstall the Zoom app, you can visit [https://app.incident.io/api/zoom_uninstall](https://app.incident.io/api/zoom_uninstall), which will revoke the existing credentials and clear any Zoom data from incident.io systems.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Meeting not found">
    We need to look up data about the call, in order to fetch information about the people who are participating. If you see this error, it is because we weren't able to fetch information about the current call. If the call URL was set manually, please check that the call can be accessed by the Zoom account that was used to connect the Zoom integration.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Host has disallowed web clients">
    This means that the meeting host has forbidden joining the call from the web, which prevents Scribe from joining. Sometimes, this can be because E2E encryption has been enabled for the call.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I've enabled Scribe, but it's not joining my calls?">
    We require new permissions for Zoom and Google Meet to enable call transcription. If you previously had those integrations setup it might be that you are using an older version of our permissions.

    Please make sure to update to the latest by re-authenticating the integration to ensure you have the right permissions.

    If you're still seeing issues with Zoom, please check your settings in the Zoom app to ensure that recording has been allowed.

    <img src="/images/integrations/zoom/scribe-recording-settings.png" alt="Zoom recording settings" />

    If **this is the first time you've installed Zoom**, we recommend to ensure you've ticked the option to allow shared access permissions at the bottom referenced in step 3 above.

    Should you continue to experience issues, please reach out to support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Scribe is joining my Zoom calls, why am I not seeing a transcript?">
    We rely on Zoom meeting captions to generate the transcript of your call. If the bot joined your call but you're not seeing a transcript after a few minutes, it could be because you have meeting captions disabled.

    To enable meeting captions, navigate to **Host Caption Control Settings** while in a Zoom meeting, then enable the setting called **Allow Closed Captioning for this meeting.**

    <img src="/images/integrations/zoom/host-caption-control.png" alt="Host caption control settings" />

    <img src="/images/integrations/zoom/allow-closed-captioning.png" alt="Allow closed captioning option" />

    If you don't see the option to enable meeting captions in your Zoom client, you likely have the setting turned off globally.

    To resolve this, simply go to [Zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting?tab=meeting) and flip the toggle for **Automated captions.**

    <img src="/images/integrations/zoom/automated-captions-settings.png" alt="Automated captions settings" />

    If **this is the first time you've installed Zoom**, we recommend to ensure you've ticked the option to allow shared access permissions at the bottom referenced in step 3 above.
