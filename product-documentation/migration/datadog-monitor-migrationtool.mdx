<StatusBanner status="PLACEHOLDER" />

If you have many Datadog monitors pointing to PagerDuty or Opsgenie, our migration tool can automatically update everything to point to incident.io.

<Warning>
  The Datadog migration tool is currently in beta. It's available as a private GitHub repository. Contact our support team at help@incident.io to get access.
</Warning>

## What the tool does

The migration tool automates the process of updating your Datadog monitors to use incident.io instead of your current on-call provider. It handles the entire migration workflow:

- Walks you through webhook configuration options (single webhook vs. multiple webhooks)
- Automatically creates webhook configurations in Datadog
- Updates your monitors to point to incident.io
- Removes your previous on-call provider (PagerDuty or Opsgenie) references when migration is successful

The tool is flexible and can be used via command line, interactive prompts, or config file. It has a dry run mode to preview changes without modifying monitors
