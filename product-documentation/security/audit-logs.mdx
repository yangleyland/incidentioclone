Audit logs give you visibility into changes made within your incident.io account. They track configuration changes, permission updates, and system actions, providing a complete record of who changed what and when.

Use audit logs to meet compliance requirements, investigate unexpected changes, or understand how your incident.io setup evolved over time. Available on the [Enterprise plan](https://incident.io/pricing), logs are powered by [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) and retained for one year.

Access audit logs at **Settings → Security**. View entries in the dashboard, export to CSV, or stream to your SIEM provider.

<Note>
Audit log entries are available from April 18, 2023 onwards. You must be an Owner or Admin to access audit logs.

## What's tracked

Audit logs track configuration changes across incident.io, including:
- Alert sources, routes, and escalation paths
- Schedule and on-call configuration changes
- User role assignments and permission updates
- Access grants to private incidents
- Workflow and automation changes
- Integration configurations

Each entry captures the actor (person or system making the change), the target (what was modified), and contextual details like location and user agent. Entries conform to a versioned schema documented in the [API reference](https://api-docs.incident.io/tag/Audit-logs), ensuring consistent parsing as the format evolves.

## Viewing audit logs

View audit logs in the [security settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/security) dashboard. Filter entries by target, event type, actor, and date. Export to CSV for a specific time period, or set up continuous streaming to your SIEM provider.

## Streaming to SIEM providers

Stream audit logs directly to your security information and event management (SIEM) platform. incident.io supports streaming to:
- Datadog
- Splunk
- Amazon S3 buckets
- Other WorkOS-compatible providers

## API access

Access audit log entries programmatically via the incident.io API. See the [Audit logs API documentation](https://api-docs.incident.io/tag/Audit-logs) for available endpoints and schema details.
