# Housekeeping and tidy up

When the immediate impact is over, closing your incident properly keeps your records clean and helps your team move into post-incident learning and improvement.

## Resolving incidents

Once you've fixed the issue and confirmed there's no more ongoing impact, you'll want to resolve the incident. This moves it from active response mode into either the post-incident flow or closed state.

**From Slack:**
- In your incident channel (`#inc-...`), use `/incident status` and update to your resolution status
- Or use `/inc resolve` to directly mark the incident as resolved

**From the dashboard:**
- Go to the incident's homepage
- Click **Share update** in the top right
- Update the status to your resolution status

When you resolve an incident, you'll be prompted about whether to enter the post-incident flow. This is where your team can complete tasks like writing post-mortems, scheduling debriefs, and reviewing follow-ups.

## Moving to post-incident

After resolving, you have two options:

**Enter the post-incident flow** - Choose this if you want to learn from the incident. You'll be guided through tasks like reviewing the timeline, creating a post-mortem document, and scheduling a debrief. The incident automatically progresses through these tasks and closes when complete.

**Skip to closed** - Choose this for minor incidents that don't need reflection. The incident closes immediately without going through post-incident tasks.

Your organization can configure which incidents automatically require the post-incident flow (like all major incidents) in **Settings > Respond > Lifecycle**. Even if it's not required, responders can always opt in or out.

## What happens after resolution

Once an incident is resolved (and any post-incident tasks are complete), a few things happen automatically:

- The incident timeline is preserved with all events, updates, and timestamps
- The incident channel can be archived according to your team's configuration
- All incident data remains searchable and available for reporting in Insights
- Follow-ups you've created remain tracked and can be exported to tools like Jira

The incident remains in your system permanently for learning and analysis, even after the channel is archived.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I reopen an incident after it's closed?">
    Yes. From the incident Slack channel, use `/inc update` and change the status back to an active status. You can also do this from the dashboard by clicking **Share update** on the incident's homepage.

    If your incident channel has been archived, you'll need to unarchive it in Slack first (go to the channel settings and click "Unarchive"), then update the status.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I edit the incident timeline after closing?">
    Yes. The timeline is completely customizable even after an incident is closed. You can add your own narrative or events that happened in external systems. Learn more in the [Timeline documentation](/product-documentation/incident-response/timeline).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I opt out of the post-incident flow?">
    If an incident enters the post-incident flow but you decide it's not worthwhile, type `/inc close` in the incident channel or select **Opt out of post-incident** in the overflow menu on the dashboard. You'll need to provide a reason, which will be included in the message sent to the Slack channel.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I want to rename an incident after closing?">
    You can rename an incident at any time, even after it's closed. From the incident's Slack channel, use `/inc rename`, or from the Incident Homepage, open the menu in the top right and click "Rename incident".
