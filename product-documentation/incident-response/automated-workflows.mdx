Workflows automate actions during incident response, handling repetitive tasks so your team can focus on resolution. When an incident is created or updated, workflows can assign roles, create actions, send notifications, or prompt decision flows based on conditions you define.

For comprehensive workflow documentation including all triggers, steps, and configuration options, see the [Workflows section](/product-documentation/workflows/overview).

## Incident-specific workflow triggers

Workflows run when specific incident events occur. incident.io offers three incident-related triggers:

**When an incident is created or changed**
- Runs when incidents are created or when incident fields update (severity, status, custom fields, etc.)
- Most common trigger for incident automation
- Use conditions to control which incidents or field changes activate the workflow

**When someone joins an incident channel**
- Runs when users join the incident Slack channel
- Useful for onboarding messages or assigning tasks to new responders
- Can filter by user role or incident properties

**When someone posts a message in an incident channel**
- Runs on new messages in the incident channel
- Enables automation based on message content or emoji reactions
- Excludes incident updates and messages from `/inc update` command

<Tip>
Use workflow conditions to narrow when triggers fire. For example, trigger on "incident is created or changed" but add conditions for "severity is Critical" to run only on high-severity incidents.
</Tip>

## Common incident workflows

**Assign incident roles automatically**
- When critical incidents are created, invite specific users or on-call engineers to the channel
- Assign incident lead based on severity or affected service

**Create incident actions**
- Generate follow-up actions when incidents reach certain milestones
- Create actions automatically for specific incident types (e.g., security incidents require review tasks)

**Send notifications and updates**
- Post announcements to status channels when incidents are created
- Send direct messages to stakeholders based on incident properties
- Alert teams when incidents escalate or change severity

**Prompt decision flows**
- Guide responders through decision trees for complex scenarios
- Ask whether to update status pages, notify regulators, or escalate to leadership
- Ensure consistent decision-making during high-pressure incidents

**Escalate to on-call teams**
- Page PagerDuty or Opsgenie escalation policies when incidents match criteria
- Route incidents to appropriate teams based on affected service or custom fields

## Using expressions with incident data

Expressions let you vary workflow behavior based on incident data, making one workflow handle multiple scenarios.

**Example use case:**
Route incidents to different on-call teams based on affected service:

- If **Affected Service** is **Payments** → **Escalation Team** = **Payments Team**
- Else if **Affected Service** is **Onboarding** → **Escalation Team** = **Onboarding Team**
- Else → **Escalation Team** is not set

When configuring workflow steps, click **Use a variable** and select **Add new expression**. Choose your expression type, define conditions based on incident fields, and return values like Slack channels, users, or text. Use these expressions in subsequent workflow steps.

Expressions support:
- Incident fields (severity, status, custom fields)
- Catalog attributes (services, teams)
- User data and roles
- Multiple return values for looping over lists

For detailed expression configuration, see [Workflow expressions](/product-documentation/workflows/expressions).

## Decision flows in incident workflows

Decision flows guide responders through branching decision trees during incidents. Create a decision flow in **Settings → Decision Flows**, then trigger it with a workflow step.

**Common decision flow scenarios:**
- Determine whether to update public status pages
- Assess if regulatory reporting is required (GDPR, SOC 2)
- Choose escalation paths based on impact and scope
- Decide communication channels for different stakeholder groups

Each decision flow presents prompts and options to the user in Slack. Their selections can update incident fields or trigger additional workflow steps.

To use decision flows, add the **Prompt a Decision Flow** step to your workflow and select which flow to trigger. Condition the workflow to run when appropriate (e.g., only for critical incidents or specific incident types).

For complete decision flow setup, see [Workflows overview](/product-documentation/workflows/overview).

## Related features

**[Incident actions](/product-documentation/incident-response/incident-actions)**
Create and track follow-up tasks during and after incidents. Workflows can automatically generate actions based on incident properties.

**[Nudges](/product-documentation/incident-response/nudges)**
Automated reminders that prompt responders to update incident status or complete required fields. Work alongside workflows to maintain incident hygiene.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can workflows run on private incidents?">
    By default, workflows don't run on private incidents to prevent bypassing membership protections. Account owners can enable workflows on private incidents by opening **Advanced settings** and toggling **Run on private incidents**.

    Only account owners can modify private workflows, and the responsibility is on them to ensure workflows don't expose more of the incident than intended.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I trigger workflows based on emoji reactions?">
    Use the text version of the emoji in trigger conditions, not the emoji symbol. For example, use "ticket" instead of "🎫" or ":ticket:".

    Workflows only trigger for reactions to regular messages in Slack, not incident updates or messages from `/inc update` commands.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I loop over multiple values in workflow steps?">
    Yes. Use the **Create a loop** step to repeat actions for each value in multi-select custom fields or expressions that return lists.

    For example, loop over an "Affected Teams" custom field to page each team's escalation policy. If the field updates during the incident, the loop automatically runs for new values without re-executing previous iterations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if a workflow step fails?">
    If a step fails, incident.io stops executing subsequent steps in that workflow run. Check workflow activity logs to see which step failed and why.

    If an expression returns no value and a step requires that value, the workflow skips remaining steps from that point.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I test workflows before setting them live?">
    Click **Test** when editing a workflow and select a test incident. incident.io runs the workflow steps (but not conditions) against that incident.

    For workflows involving users (like direct messages), choose yourself as the test user to avoid sending unexpected messages to others.
