Incidents in a post-incident status can be closed via [our API](https://api-docs.incident.io/).

This is particularly useful for teams that carry out follow-up actions from incidents in external tools, and want to automatically close the incident in [incident.io](http://incident.io) once those tasks are complete.

### Prerequisites

To use this feature, you must use an API Key with a specific scope. This ensures that incidents aren't accidentally closed without a proper review unless explicitly authorized.


1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > API Keys**
2. Create a new API Key
3. Ensure the key has the **Close incidents by opting out of the post-incident flow** permission enabled

### How to use it

You can transition the incident by using the [Edit Incident endpoint](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://api-docs.incident.io/%23operation/Incidents_Update) (`PATCH /v1/incidents/{id}`).


- **From:** The incident must currently be in a valid post-incident status (e.g., `Resolved`, `Fixing`)
- **To:** The target status must be `Closed`

When you successfully close an incident via the API:


- The incident status moves to **Closed**
- The incident is marked as "opted" of the post-incident flow
