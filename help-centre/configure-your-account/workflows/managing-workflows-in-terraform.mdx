Managing workflows in terraform is useful if you:

- Want to use version control to preview and roll-back changes to a workflow
- Want to apply complex access control (e.g. only members of the SRE team can edit specific core SRE workflows)
- Want to create workflows programatically based on other data that you store in Terraform

## Building your Terraform

Workflows have a pretty complex structure, so we’d recommend you build your workflow in the UI using our visual builder, and then copy the Terraform that we generate into your repo.

## Making the dashboard ‘Terraform aware’

We want to make sure the dashboard understands that you’re managing a workflow via Terraform, and can adapt accordingly.

You can easily see which workflows are managed via Terraform:

You can tell us where your Terraform code is stored, so it’s easy for your colleagues to find and update it:

We warn you before you make a change that would pull the workflow out of sync with your Terraform state:

You can find out more in our [Terraform provider docs.](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest/docs/resources/workflow) ​

## API Key Permissions

As part of the setup you'll need to create an incident.io API Key. To do *all the things* we currently support in Terraform, you'll want to look at giving the key the following permissions. However, you can always refine this if you're only looking to manage certain components. ​
