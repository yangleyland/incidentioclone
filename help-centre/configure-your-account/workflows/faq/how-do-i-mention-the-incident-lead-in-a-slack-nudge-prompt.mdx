## Context

When configuring messages in workflows or nudges for incidents, you may want to include a mention of the Incident Lead to ensure they are notified. This requires using the correct syntax to properly mention the user in Slack.

## Answer

To mention the Incident Lead in a Slack nudge prompt, simply use `Incident->Incident Lead` in your configuration. The system will automatically handle the proper Slack mention formatting - there's no need to add the `@` symbol before the variable.
