## Why AI?

We are always looking for ways to improve your organization's incident response. Whether that is improving the lives of responders as they react in the heat of the moment or distilling previous incidents into powerful learnings. We want to make sure things are quick, easy, and understandable.

For us, artificial intelligence (AI) is potentially the perfect partner to help take away some of the overhead. It can help when you're trying to digest huge amounts of information or communicate clearly and quickly to stakeholders.

Although it is early days, we strongly believe it has a pivotal role in helping you remain in the flow and getting on with the nitty-gritty while it focuses on the bigger picture. Think of it like a helpful colleague chipping in or taking tasks off your hands when it can.

## What AI features have we built?

You can view all of our AI features in [this collection](/help-centre/ai-features) .

## How do our AI solutions work?

Our AI features are powered by OpenAI and Anthropic.

We send data on-demand to their API when required by a feature. This data is not stored by OpenAI or Anthropic and is not used for any reason other than to provide these services. This means it is explicitly *not* used for training purposes.

OpenAI and Anthropic are listed as our data sub-processors, so all customers automatically consent during sign up. However, if you'd like for us to stop sending data to OpenAI or Anthropic, and therefore disable all AI features, please reach out to us.

### What data is required for AI features?

<Info>

**Note** : Detail about data storage is discussed more in our [Trust Centre.](https://incident.io/security)

</Info>

Our AI features use a number of different datapoints to provide accurate responses. These datapoints include (but are not limited to) incident updates, summaries, and custom fields. We send this data on-demand to OpenAI. This data is not stored by OpenAI, and is not used for any reason other than to provide these services.
