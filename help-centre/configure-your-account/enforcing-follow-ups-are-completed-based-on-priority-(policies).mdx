### Introduction

You can use policies to define rules about how your organization completes follow-ups, however, you may want to configure this further based on the priority of the given follow-up.

This helpful article walks through creating a new policy that enforces that urgent follow-ups are completed within 3 days of the incident being resolved, and follow-ups with any other priority have 7 days to be completed.

### Steps

Head over to [Settings → Policies](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/policies) , and click [New Policy](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/policies/create) .

Select `Follow-ups` as the **Policy type** , and give the policy a **Name** and **Description** .

Within the **At what point should we enforce this policy? → SLA days** section, click the **Use an expression** button.

Select the `If... else...` expression type, and add a new expression rule:

- If `Follow-up → Priority is one of Urgent` , return `3`
- If no rule conditions are met, return `7`

This expression states that if a follow-up has a priority of `Urgent` then it should be completed within 3 days, and for any other priority the follow-up should be completed in 7 days.

Click the **Add** button to save the expression.

Within the **Follow-up requirements** section, create a new requirement:

- `Follow-up → Status is not one of Outstanding`

This requirement is enforcing that for the policy to be fulfilled, the follow-up must have a status that is not `Outstanding` , thus validating that it has been completed.
