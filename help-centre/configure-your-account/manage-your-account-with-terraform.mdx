We maintain an [official Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest) for incident.io. With this provider you can manage account configuration such as:

- Custom fields
- Incident severities
- Incident roles
- Incident statuses
- Schedules
- Escalation paths

This allows you to bring incident.io account configuration into the same code review and approval cycle as you'd use for other key infrastructure and allows syncing information about your infrastructure or organisation into incident.io, such as a list of services or teams.

As an example, this is how you might configure a custom field for affected services:

```plaintext
provider "incident" {}

resource "incident_custom_field" "impacted_services" {
  name        = "Impacted Services"
  description = "The services that are impacted by this incident."
  field_type  = "multi_select"
  required    = "always"

  show_before_creation      = true
  show_before_closure       = true
  show_before_update        = true
  show_in_announcement_post = true
}

resource "incident_custom_field_option" "impacted_services" {
  # Load this from your service catalog, config file, or anywhere.
  for_each = toset([
    "Payments Service",
    "API Gateway",
    "Transaction Ledger",
  ])

  custom_field_id = incident_custom_field.impacted_services.id
  value           = each.value
}
```

Full documentation on how to use the provider and all its resources can be found in the Terraform registry at [incident-io/incident](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest) . This includes example code and attribute definitions.
