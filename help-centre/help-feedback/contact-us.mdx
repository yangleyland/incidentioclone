</Info>

Unlike other companies who optimise for self-serve customer service (i.e. fix your own problems), we optimise for talking to as many of our users (you!) as possible.

## In-app

If you're already a customer but you're not in one of our plans that provides a direct Slack/MS Teams channel with us, you can open your organisation selector, where you'll find a "Contact support" button.

## Email

Our support team is available at [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io) .
