<Info>

For internal use only, and for using to crib responses to customers who raise this issue with workflows. This doesn't apply to other Terraform resources — just workflows.

</Info>

Sometimes, we add new parameters to our workflows, which offer new functionality. Existing workflows are silently "upgraded" to support this new parameter, which means they gain a new "parameter binding"

This can result in a Terraform error that looks like this:

```plaintext
When applying changes to incident_workflow.[name], provider "provider[\"registry.terraform.io/incident-io/incident\"]" produced an unexpected new value: .steps[1].param_bindings: new element 3 has appeared.

This is a bug in the provider, which should be reported in the provider's own issue tracker.

Error: Provider produced inconsistent result after apply
```

What Terraform is saying here, is that a new value for a parameter appeared that it wasn't expecting. We don't yet handle this gracefully, and we're not entirely sure if there's a good solution here yet.

We're going to release a new version of our Terraform provider to fix this, but in the meantime, if `param_bindings` is complaining about being changed, then they should add the missing parameter binding.

Example:

Plain Text 

```plaintext
!               param_bindings = [
-                   {
                    },
                    # (3 unchanged elements hidden)
                ]
                # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)
            },
        ]
```

That output is saying that Terraform is missing a `{}` param binding — and they should add this if they want to unblock themselves. The new version of our Terraform provider will mean this step isn't required.
