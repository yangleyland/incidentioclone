Our insights scheduled reports allow you to get snapshots of your custom dashboards, delivered to whoever you need on a regular cadence. Reports are delivered by email and can be sent to as many email addresses as you'd like.

To create a scheduled report, [navigate to the custom dashboard](https://app.incident.io/~/insights) that you'd like to send (or create a new custom dashboard). Click the *Schedule* button in the top right and the drawer will open. Enter the slack channels or email addresses of the people you'd like to send the report to and select how often you'd like to receive the report.

<Warning>

You can send insights reports to a slack channel(s) and/or any email address, inside or outside of your organisation.

</Warning>

Click the *Send a test report* button at the bottom of the drawer to send a test report to your email address. Be aware that reports can take up to a minute to generate. If you're happy with the results, click the confirmation button and your report will be sent according to your selected schedule.

You can only send scheduled reports for **custom dashboards** . Core dashboards (those that appear as tiles on the insights homepage) are not supported. If you want to schedule a report based on a core dashboard, you can create a custom dashboard with the same panels as the core dashboard you're interested in and schedule it as above.
