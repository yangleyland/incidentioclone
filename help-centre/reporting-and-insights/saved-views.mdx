Saved views let you save a collection of filters and quickly apply them later. They're great for navigating to data you check often, and for sharing useful views with your teammates.

They're available on the [incidents](https://app.incident.io/incidents) , [alerts](https://app.incident.io/on-call/alerts) , [escalations](https://app.incident.io/on-call/escalations) , [follow-ups](https://app.incident.io/follow-ups) , and tasks pages. Within [teams](/help-centre/catalog/getting-started-with-teams) them for incidents, alerts, and escalations - these are separate from org-wide views and scoped to that team's data.

To create one, apply the filters you want, click "Save view", and give it a name. That's it Once created, you can rename or delete it, or grab a shareable link to send to a colleague.

All saved views are visible to everyone in your organization.
