## Insights date range filtering

When filtering for date range inside the `insights` [page](https://app.incident.io/~/insights) , you can choose to include data from the current Week/Month/Quarter by selecting the "Include this Week/Month/Quarter" configuration found under the custom relative range.

You can also compare with the previous period by toggling it on.

## How often is Insights' data refreshed?

Insight data is refreshed roughly every three hours, this means that recently created incidents will not show up in insights.
