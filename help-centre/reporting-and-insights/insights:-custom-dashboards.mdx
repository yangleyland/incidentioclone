Custom dashboards are a powerful feature of Insights that let you build exactly the dashboard that you want to see. You can also [schedule reports to be sent based on a custom dashboard](https://intercom.help/incidentio-docs/en/articles/10032162-insights-scheduled-reports) .

## Creating a custom dashboard

To create a new custom dashboard, go to the [Insights homepage](https://app.incident.io/~/insights) , and click the "Create dashboard" button in the top right.

Give your custom dashboard a name, choose an icon and colour, and then click Create.

## Adding panels

You can add panels containing either charts or text to your custom dashboard, simply click the corresponding button on your empty dashboard:

You can add any panel from one of the core insights dashboards to your custom dashboard by selecting it from the drawer:

## Filtering the whole dashboard

You can add filters to the dashboard, and **they will affect all panels on the dashboard** . For example, you can filter so that you only see data for major incidents by using the "Add filter" button in the header bar:

## Filtering a panel

If you want to filter just a single panel in a custom dashboard, click the "Add filter" button in the header of the panel you want to filter:

The filters you add to a panel **will be applied in addition** to the filters that are added to the whole dashboard.
