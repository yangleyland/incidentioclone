## What's incident.io?

Fair question!

We're a **modern incident management platform** . We help high-growth companies like yours declare, collaborate, communicate around and learn from events that disturb their normal course of business - from critical infrastructure being down, to data breaches and security incidents.

We’re already helping hundreds of **** [happy customers](https://incident.io/love) **like Etsy, Miro, Hashicorp, Skyscanner, and StubHub** reduce their downtime and answer questions like:

- “ *I just got pulled into an incident: what’s happening, and how bad is it?* ”
- “ *Do we have the right people in the room to help?* ”
- “ *Where’s the post-mortem?* "
- “ *How many incidents did we have this month? How long did it take us to solve?* ”

We hope you'll be one of them!
