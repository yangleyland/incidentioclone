Writing post-mortems is an incredibly valuable process. It forces the writers to understand what actually happened during an incident, and a good post-mortem document can reveal the systemic issues hidden behind the surface-level problems.

Gathering the context to write a post-mortem can also be time-consuming — information has to be gathered from a variety of sources: Slack threads, logs and monitoring, email threads, and so on. That information then has to be condensed down into something coherent and readable, and then you have to gather feedback and integrate that.

Our vision of an integrated post-mortem experience, with all your incident related information at your finger tips, is the driving force behind our new post-mortem editor.

Some of the things you can do:

- Real-time collaboration. Several people can open the document at once, and you’ll each see your edits in real time. You’ll see who’s present in the document, and you can see where other peoples cursors are, and what they're highlighting.
- Commenting, and replying to comments. You can highlight text in the document, and comment on it. Others can reply to your comments, and can be mentioned in comments.
- Interacting with our integrated AI companion, asking questions and extracting information related to the incident.
- All incident and organisation related metadata at your fingertips: you can access information such as timestamps from the timeline, people involved in the incident, and custom fields associated with it, as well as the catalog, directly in the editor.

## Using the new editor

The new editor is a fully opt-in experience, enabling you to introduce it to your post-incident processes at your own pace. You are able to start using it on some incidents while maintaining your existing post-mortem writing flow on others.

Start by going to the Post-mortem Settings page and scrolling down to the template section. Clicking the Add Template button, you now have a new option: Duplicate existing template with collaborative editor. This will take an existing template that you use for post-mortems, and create a copy that is configured to use the new editor.

Once you've created the new template, all users in your organisation are now able to utilise it. To create a new post-mortem using the new template, go to an incident and click the “Create post-mortem” button and then select your newly created template in the drawer that opens to the right. Clicking “Create” will take you to the new editor.

This will drop you into the post-mortem tab and once the document has been created, you're ready to start editing!

## Exploring the editor

Take a moment to explore the functionality and deep integration with the rich information that you have access to in incident.io. If you have experience with Notion-style editors, you'll feel right at home, but we're building this to be accessible and useful to all users. You can type `/` to open up the special block menu and select rich text blocks such as Callouts, Code Blocks, Images and many more.

Additionally you can refer to data available in incident, such as Users, Slack Channels, Github PR Attachments, Catalog Entries and much more, all by typing `@` . All of these elements are interactive, and hovering over a user mention will show additional context about the user, such as their role in the incident.

Highlighting a section of text will open a contextual tool menu, where you can apply formatting such as bold or italic, comment on the text, or ask the AI questions about it. If you mention someone in a comment, they are notified.

The triple dot overflow menu in the top header has contextual actions that you can take on the post-mortem tab, such as Version History, Analytics, and Resolved Comments. The Version History consists of automatically created snapshots of your document. You can view each version and if you want to revert to an earlier version you can do that from there. The analytics show who has viewed the document and when, as well as who has edited it. Finally, you can access resolved comments through the Resolved Comments sidebar.

## Deleting new post-mortems

Our new post-mortems can be deleted from the menu mentioned above, enabling you to iterate on your template and experiment. Deleting a post-mortem removes all versions of the document and they can not be recovered, but once deleted, you'll be able to create a brand new copy. If you have modified your template, any new documents created from that template will apply the new changes.
