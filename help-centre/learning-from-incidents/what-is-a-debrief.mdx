A debrief is a Google Calendar event used for regrouping after an incident has been resolved. During a debrief, it's common to:

- Discuss the post-mortem
- Create follow-ups to stop the incident from happening again
- Invite incident responders and some key stakeholders

It may be called different names, but for now, we're referring to it as a debrief within incident.io.

If you are using our [Google Calendar integration](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/google-calendar) and include the incident ID (e.g. `INC-108` ) within the title or description of the Google Calendar event, then we will post the following in the incident Slack channel:

If you answer `"Yes, it's a debrief"` to this message, then we will pull through the details of the Google Calendar event and share them with the incident Slack channel:

## Removing a debrief

If you have followed the flow above to attach a Google Calendar event as a debrief to an incident, you can always remove it from the sidebar on the incident details page:
