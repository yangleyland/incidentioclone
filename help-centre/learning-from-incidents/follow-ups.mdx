We believe you create two types of actions during an incident – those that **need doing now** and those that should be followed up after an incident has been closed.

Actions that **need doing now** might be:

- Reboot that server
- Send some comms to an affected customer

While **follow-ups** could be:

- Improve test coverage of a given codepath
- Share the debrief document with all affected customers

You can learn more about actions [here](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/actions) .

## How do I create follow-ups?

There are three ways you can do this:

1. **React** with the : *fast_forward* : emoji to any Slack message within the incident channel

You can then export the follow-up to an issue tracker, via the Incident Homepage (or directly in Slack for Jira).

2. Use the command **/inc follow-up,** to create new follow-ups and post any open follow-ups within the channel

3. Create the follow-up directly in your issue tracker, and paste a link into the Slack channel

## What can I do with follow-ups?

## Editing follow-ups

If a follow-up is exported to an external issue tracker like Jira, we'll listen for changes and keep the follow-up in line on our side.

If it isn't, you can manage it via Slack (using `/inc follow-ups` ) or via the incident homepage from the Follow-ups tab.

You can also assign a **Priority** to a follow-up, to help drive Policies and communicate the difference between follow-ups. You can read more about [Follow-up Priorities](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/assigning-a-priority-to-follow-ups) .

## Tracking follow-ups

You can track follow-ups from the [Follow-ups](https://app.incident.io/follow-ups) page in the web dashboard. This allows you to see the status of follow-ups across all your incidents, as well as take actions such as sending reminders and bulk-editing follow-ups.
