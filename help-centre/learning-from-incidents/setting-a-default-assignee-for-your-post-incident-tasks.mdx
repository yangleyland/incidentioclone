When an incident enters [the post-incident flow](/help-centre/configure-your-account/define-your-post-incident-process-using-the-post-incident-flow) , we create a set of tasks like `Create the postmortem` which must be addressed.

It's possible to rely on these tasks being picked up proactively, but if you're on our **Pro** or **Enterprise** plans you'll see the option to set a default assignee from the [task settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/post-incident-flow) ! This means that tasks are more likely to get done, and incidents progress through the post-incident flow quicker.

## Who should be the default assignee?

You might want all tasks to be assigned to the lead so they can delegate. Alternatively you might choose for some tasks to be assigned to a particular role (for example, the `Schedule a debrief` task might be assigned to the `Debrief scheduler` role).

You can also create an expression here, which means we'll assign different people under different conditions:

Our default is that the lead should be automatically assigned to all tasks, but you can change this in [Settings > Post-incident flow](https://app.incident.io/settings/post-incident-flow) by clicking "edit" on each task.

Note that the default assignee is optional, so if you don't want your tasks to be automatically assigned you can just clear the defaults we've set for you.

## When will they get assigned?

When an incident first enters the post-incident flow we will automatically assign the tasks for you.

Because we support expressions like "when the severity is critical" here, we'll also re-evaluate who should be assigned whenever an incident changes. So if it looks like the assignee should be someone else, we'll update the assignee and notify the new person.

## Can I override this?

Yes! If you assign a task manually, we will no longer try to assign that task automatically.
