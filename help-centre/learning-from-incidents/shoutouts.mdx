Sometimes, you need to shoutout a contribution by a coworker during an incident. Now you can with the shoutout command.

1. In an incident channel, type the command /inc shoutout or click the ' Give a shoutout' button.

3. You can customize where shoutouts get posted in [the Automation settings](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/automation) . This way you can collect shoutouts in a separate #gratitude channel.
