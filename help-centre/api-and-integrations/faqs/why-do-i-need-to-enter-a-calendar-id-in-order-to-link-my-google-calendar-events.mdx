For a full breakdown of our Google Calendar integration; including how it works and how to install it, head over to [this article](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/google-calendar) .

</Info>

Our [Google Calendar integration](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations/google-calendar/configure) allows incident.io to listen for relevant meetings that are created within Google calendars, which we are subscribed to. Simply referencing an incident ID (e.g. `INC-108` ) within a meeting title or description, will result in the meeting being attached to the relevant incident.

To set this integration up, we require the ID of the Google calendar so that we can create the subscription and listen for new events being created.

We deliberately took this path to protect our customers' privacy, and limit the amount of permissions that we request from your Google account. The only permission we request is:

```plaintext
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
```

This allows us to read details about events in a specific calendar, and create new events (e.g. [generating a Google Meet](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/google-meet) call when an incident is created).

Therefore, it is in your control which calendars we are allowed to look at for incident-related events, rather than have us check all calendars the connected user is subscribed to.
