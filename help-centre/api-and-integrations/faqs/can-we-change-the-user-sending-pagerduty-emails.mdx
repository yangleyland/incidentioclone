Unfortunately, no.

If you [added PagerDuty to incident.io](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/alternative-on-call-management-solutions/pagerduty) , you probably realised all escalations appear to be sent by the same user. Unfortunately, we currently don't have a way to change the sender of the email: due to a limitation of the PagerDuty API, all escalations will originate from the email of the user that connected PagerDuty to your [incident.io](http://incident.io/) account.

When you create an incident, it must always be associated with the email of a valid PagerDuty user, as bots (i.e., us) are not allowed to create incidents on their own.

If you'd rather not have incidents attached to a user's email, **you could create a dedicated account in PagerDuty** and connect that to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) . However, be aware PagerDuty will charge you for the extra seat.
