**Yes we do!**

Statuspage has a great feature inbuilt that allows you to pre-fill the impact, update text, and affected components. This makes it less stressful when figuring out what to write.

All of the configuration of the templates is done within Statuspage, so all you need to do is use the command `/inc statuspage ` and the modal will appear for you to select which template you'd like to use.
