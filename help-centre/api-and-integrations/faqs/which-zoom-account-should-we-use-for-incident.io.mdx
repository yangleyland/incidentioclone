We recommend using a **service account** .

Why? Whoever we authorise against will be assigned as the Zoom meeting 'host', so if you use one of your team members's account:

- It might be confusing to imply a human created the meeting rather than a Zoom account called " [incident.io](http://incident.io/) bot", for example;
- It will also always be the same human, which might add to the confusion;
- That team member's calendar will virtually explode;
- You could lose access to the Zoom integration if the individual leaves.

If you're struggling with the Zoom integration, [get in touch](http://incident.io/community) !
