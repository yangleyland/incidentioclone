You can integrate Vanta with your incident.io account!

Using Vanta's Connectors API you can connect your Vanta account to track any follow-ups matching the conditions you define as Security Tasks in Vanta.

## What can I do with this integration?

1. Auditing of users with access to your [incident.io](http://incident.io/) account, and of those with elevated privileges. This lets your Vanta auditor quickly and painlessly check that you're being careful with giving out admin/owner privileges, and provides evidence that leavers are locked out quickly.

2. Track follow-ups as 'security tasks' inside Vanta: this lets security teams have their incident follow-ups tracked in Vanta, so they can provide evidence that they're meeting any SLAs on them (e.g. 'we complete all security tasks within 2 weeks, in compliance with SOC II').

## How do I set this up?

1. Navigate to the [integrations settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations) within incident.io and click `Install` next to the Vanta option. We'll bounce you straight to Vanta's app and ask you to accept the security policies.

2. Add conditions to incidents that should have their follow-ups tracked in Vanta.

It's as easy as that!
