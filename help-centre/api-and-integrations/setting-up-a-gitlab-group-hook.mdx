We rely on a GitLab Group Hook to enable:

1. **Syncing changes to follow-ups in GitLab back to incident.io**

2. **Linking merge requests to incidents automatically** when you mention the incident reference (e.g. `INC-123` ) in a merge request.

3. **Posting updates to merge requests in the incident channel** , for example when a linked MR is merged.

## Setting up

<Warning>

You'll need a GitLab Group Owner to do this setup.

</Warning>

#### 1. Find your secret token

Under [Settings → Integrations → GitLab](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations/gitlab) , you'll find a unique secret token. Copy this down - you'll need it to successfully configure the hook.

#### 2. Create the hook

Within your top-level group, click **Settings** then **Webhooks** :

Then ' **Add new webhook** '.

For the **URL** use `https://app.incident.io/webhooks/gitlab` .

For the **Secret token** , paste in the secret token from the incident.io dashboard.

Under **Trigger** , select:

Issues events

Merge request events

Everything else can be left as the default. Click **Add webhook** .

#### 3. Verify the connection

In [Settings → Integrations → GitLab](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations/gitlab) , you can see when the last webhook was received. Make a small change to an issue to trigger a webhook:

**You're all set**
