Connect incident.io with ServiceNow to bring your user groups and services from CMDB into Catalog.

## Connecting ServiceNow

incident.io connects to ServiceNow using a **OAuth app** and **Web Service user account** . Let's get started with the OAuth app.

<Warning>

You will need a ServiceNow Admin to complete these steps.

</Warning>

## 1. Create an OAuth App

Log in to ServiceNow and search for " **OAuth** " in the filter navigation:

![](/images/help-centre/servicenow/screenshot-1.png)

Select **Application Registry** , and click **New** .

![](/images/help-centre/servicenow/screenshot-2.png)

Select **Create an OAuth API endpoint for external clients** .

Enter 'incident.io' for the name, and add 'useraccount' to the Auth Scopes section. Leave other options as the defaults:

Find the app you've just created in the list. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** values: we'll need them later!

## 2. Create a Web Service Account

<Info>

Any ServiceNow user account can be used so long as it has the relevant roles assigned. However, any actions taken by incident.io in ServiceNow will appear as being taken by this user account, so we strongly recommend creating a user for this purpose only.

</Info>

In ServiceNow, search for ' **User Administration** ' in the filter navigation:

![](/images/help-centre/servicenow/screenshot-4.png)

Select **Users** , then click **New** in the top-right.

Select a **username** and **email** , for example 'incident.io' and ' [incidentio-service@my-domain.com](mailto:incidentio-service@my-domain.com) ':

Make sure **Password needs reset** and **Locked out** are not selected, and **Active** and **Web service access only** are selected.

Click **Submit** , then navigate to the newly-created user.

At the bottom, select the **Roles** tab, then **Edit...** . Add the following roles:

- `cmdb_read` : allows us to read data from your Configuration Management Database
- `sn_cmdb_user` : allows us to read information about users and groups in your ServiceNow account
- `incident_manager` : allows us to sync incident data in to ServiceNow incident records

Click **Save** to apply these changes and return to the user page.

Click **Set Password** , then **Generate** , then **Save Password** .

Copy the newly-generated password, we'll need it shortly!

## 3. Installing the integration

We're now ready to install the ServiceNow integration in incident.io.

Go to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations/servicenow) , and click on **ServiceNow** , then **Connect** .

![](/images/help-centre/servicenow/screenshot-8.png)

Use the following details:

- Your **subdomain** is the part of the URL where you log in to ServiceNow. For example, if your ServiceNow instance is accessed at `hyper-payments.service-now.com` , your subdomain is `hyper-payments` .
- Your **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret** are the credentials you created in [part 1](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/servicenow)
- Your **Username** and **Password** are the credentials for the service account you created in [part 2](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/servicenow)
- Click **Connect** to verify your credentials and complete the connection

If you have any issues, please get in touch.
