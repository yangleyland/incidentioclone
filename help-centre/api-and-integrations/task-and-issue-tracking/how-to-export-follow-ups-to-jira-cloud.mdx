Follow-ups are a really important part of any incident management process, and with incident.io, you can export any remaining follow-ups to issue trackers, such as Jira Cloud.

After you've [integrated your incident.io account with your Jira Cloud account](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/jira) , navigate to [follow-ups within the dashboard](https://app.incident.io/follow-ups) , here you'll be able to see any outstanding and completed follow-ups from incidents you've had. You'll also be able to see if anyone has been assigned the follow-up to complete.

Even better, if someone marks a follow-up as completed in Jira, the follow-ups dashboard in incident.io will reflect this, and vice versa.

## Exporting single follow-ups

With your follow-ups dashboard, you can export single follow-ups as new tickets or connect them to existing tickets and choose which project they are exported to.

If you're creating a new ticket, you can assign it to yourself, or someone else, as well as giving them a description.

## Connecting follow-ups to existing Jira tickets

Instead of creating a new ticket, you can connect a follow-up to an existing ticket, helping folks close the loop.

This can also be done by simply pasting a link to the Jira ticket in the incident's slack channel.

*Note: You can only link existing Jira issues that don't have a status of Done*

## Setting "paragraph" custom fields in Jira when exporting follow-ups

- If you're manually exporting follow-ups, you'll be prompted to enter a value for the "paragraph" field during the export process.
- For automatic follow-up exports, you can configure the field to populate based on incident properties when you set up your export template.
