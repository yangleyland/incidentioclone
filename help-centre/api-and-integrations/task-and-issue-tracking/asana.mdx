Using Asana to track your team's tasks? Want to export [your incident follow-ups](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/keeping-track-of-who's-doing-what) to Asana to keep everything centralised?

This is how.

## What we can do with Asana

Our current integration is a fairly simple setup for now. In its present state, the integration lets you:

1. **Export** [your incident follow-ups](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/keeping-track-of-who's-doing-what) to Asana; and
2. **Sync the status of your tasks between Asana and incident.io** , so you can work in Asana without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!
3. [Auto-export follow-ups](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/auto-exporting-follow-ups) to a Asana project, based on pre-configured rules

If there's more you'd like to do with incident.io and Asana, [get in touch](http://incident.io/community) to give us your wishlist! ​
