## What our GitLab integration can do

1. **Export** [your incident follow-ups](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/follow-ups) **to GitLab**

You can export your follow-ups to GitLab. We'll sync the status of your tasks, so you can work in GitLab without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!

<Tip>

Use [auto-export follow-ups](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/auto-exporting-follow-ups)  to make sure all your follow-up tasks are tracked in GitLab

</Tip>

You'll see the option to export your follow-ups from the incident homepage:

2. **Link GitLab issues to your follow-ups.**

You can copy the reference of issues you already have and linked them back to your incident.io follow-ups.

3. **Attach GitLab Merge Requests to incidents from Slack**

You can attach GitLab MRs to your incident directly from the incident channel.

4. **Attach GitLab MRs to incidents from GitLab**

You can also attach an MR by mentioning the incident number in the MR title or source branch.

## Setting Up

Adding GitLab to incident.io is simple.

<Warning>

You'll need a GitLab top-level group owner to perform some of these steps.

</Warning>

#### 1. Create a Service Account user in GitLab

Follow [GitLab's guide to creating a service account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/service_accounts.html#create-a-service-account) . We recommend using 'incident.io' for the `name` , since this will show up in the UI on issues and comments created by the integration.

<Info>

Make sure the bot user has access to create and edit issues, and view and comment on merge requests in all relevant projects.

</Info>

We recommend assigning the `Reporter` role to your incident.io service account user.

See GitLab.com: [Permissions and roles](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html)

#### 2. Create a personal access token with no expiry

Follow [GitLab's guide here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html#create-a-service-account-personal-access-token-with-no-expiry-date) .

For **scopes** , pass `api` . For **name** use 'incident.io integration'.

Note the token value for the next step!

#### 3. Connect the integration

Go to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations) , click on GitLab, then Connect.

Paste in the access token created in step 2. and click **Connect** . That's it

<Info>

For GitLab users to connect with their incident.io accounts, their GitLab public email must:

1. Match their incident.io user email
2. Be visible on their GitLab profile

</Info>

If you're using self-managed GitLab, make sure traffic from [our IPs](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/allowlisting-ip-addresses) can reach your instance.

#### → Next up

We recommend adding a Group Hook in GitLab, which allows us to sync changes in GitLab back to incident.io. Read our [setup guide here](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/setting-up-a-gitlab-group-hook) .
