Use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) for error tracking, or performance monitoring? To keep everything organised, you can now link issues and incidents.

You can read Sentry’s documentation on our integration [here](https://docs.sentry.io/product/integrations/issue-tracking/incidentio/) .

## What we can do with Sentry

1. **Link Sentry issues to incidents** From a Sentry issue, just as you can link to Issue Trackers such as Jira, Linear and GitHub, you can also link to [incident.io](http://incident.io/)
2. **Attach Sentry Issues to incidents** When a Sentry link is posted in an incident Slack channel, it’ll offer to attach it
3. **Keeping you up-to-date** Activity on the Sentry Issue will be propagated to the incident Slack channel:

## Installation

1. **Go to Settings >** [Integrations](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations)

2. **Press 'Connect' next to Sentry**
