Using Linear to track your team's tasks? Using Linear to *triage* your team's tasks?

This is how you can export [your incident to-dos](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/keeping-track-of-who's-doing-what) to Linear to keep everything centralized, *and* automatically assign tasks according to your [incident schedules](/help-centre/on-call/schedules/building-schedules) .

## What we can do with Linear

### Assign triage tickets automatically

If you use [On-call](https://incident.io/on-call) with incident.io, you can combine this with [Linear's Triage functionality](https://linear.app/docs/triage) to automatically action triage tasks to who is currently on call on your incident.io schedules.

### → Exporting follow-ups

1. **Export** [your incident follow-ups](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/follow-ups) to Linear;

2. **Sync the status of your tasks between Linear and incident.io** , so you can work in Linear without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!

3. **Bulk Exports through the Follow-ups tab.**

4. **Export templates,** this enables you to pre-set values to fields that can be used when exporting follow-ups.
