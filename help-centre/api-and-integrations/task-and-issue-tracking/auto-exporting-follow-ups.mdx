Eliminate the hassle of manually exporting follow-ups by configuring them to export automatically to your issue tracker.

This guide walks through the configuration process and demonstrates how to auto-export follow-ups to specific projects based on incident details, like custom field values.

## Setup Integrations

Before configuring the auto-export rules, ensure that you have the correct issue tracker providers installed as integrations.

Navigate to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations) , and install your issue tracker.

## Configure Export Templates

When auto-exporting a follow-up, an **export template** will be used to set certain properties of the issue, for example:

- The project the issue is assigned to
- The user that owns the issue
- Labels that are added to the issue

Navigate to [Settings → Follow-ups](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/follow-ups) , and add a new **export template** .

## Configure Conditions

Navigate to [Settings → Follow-ups](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/follow-ups) , and enable **auto-export** .

Out of the box, the **export template** you just created will be used to automatically export all follow-ups from all non-private incidents.

If you would like to configure when follow-ups should be automatically exported, and which **export template** should be used, then you will need to add a new condition.

In the example below:

- If the incident's `Affected Team` custom field is set to `ProductOps`
- Then automatically export the incident's follow-ups using the `ProductOps Team Export Template`
- If the custom field does not match, then do not automatically export follow-ups for the incident

## Fallback Behaviour

The example above has configured the fallback behaviour to not automatically export follow-ups if conditions do not match, however you can instead select a default template to be used.

This will ensure that follow-ups will always be automatically exported for each incident.

## Private Incidents

By default, auto-exporting of follow-ups is disabled for private incidents, however you can enable this on the [Settings → Follow-ups](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/follow-ups) page.
