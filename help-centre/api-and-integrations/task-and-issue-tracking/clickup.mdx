## What we can do with ClickUp

Our current integration is a fairly simple setup for now. In its present state, the integration lets you:

1. **Export** [your incident follow-ups](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/keeping-track-of-who's-doing-what) to ClickUp; and
2. **Sync the status of your tasks between ClickUp and incident.io** , so you can work in ClickUp without worrying about updating statuses manually in incident.io!
3. [Auto-export follow-ups](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/auto-exporting-follow-ups)  to ClickUp, based on pre-configured rules
