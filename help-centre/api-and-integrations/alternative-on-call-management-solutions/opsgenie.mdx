In an incident, at the boundaries of your knowledge and need help to figure something out? We've all been there.

With [incident.io](http://incident.io/) , you can use `/incident escalate` **to** **directly page users in Slack** — no need to log into Opsgenie, search around and find the right place!

You can also [automatically trigger incidents](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/alerts-and-automatic-incident-creation) when an alert fires in Opsgenie using our Incident Triggers feature.

## Setting Up

You can connect Opsgenie to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) in just a few clicks.

️ *For this integration to work, your Opsgenie account will need to be on the 'Standard' or 'Enterprise' plan. This is a* [limitation of Opsgenie](https://docs.opsgenie.com/docs/essentials-plan-restrictions#serviceincident-operations-through-api) *, where they restrict access to the Incidents API to these tiers.*

1. **Go to Settings >** [Integrations](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations)

2. **Press 'Install' next to Opsgenie**

3. **Fetch your API key from Opsgenie**

You'll need to create an API key by heading to the settings page of [your Opsgenie account](https://app.opsgenie.com/auth/login) .

You can find this by heading to 'Settings' and then scrolling down to 'API key management'. The page will look something like this:

Click *Add new API key*

- Call it " [incident.io](http://incident.io/) "
- Set access rights:
  - We require Read, Create, Delete, Update and Configuration access
  - We require a 'Global integration' API Key
  - We don't delete resources that aren't managed by incident.io
  - We will create 2 integrations one of type `API` and another of type `Webhook`: we need the deletion permission so that we can clean up any resources we create if you were to uninstall the Opsgenie integration

Copy the key to your clipboard.

4. **Paste the API key** from your clipboard into the incident.io modal

## Escalating an incident

Just head over to the incident's Slack channel and hit `/incident escalate` .

**Who can I page?**

- *A team* : we'll use the settings you've defined for the team to page whoever's on-call.
- *Any user on Opsgenie* : sometimes, you know that special someone that can help you out when you get stuck. Escalate to them directly, and bring them in to help.
- *Both the above at once!* In the middle of a particularly gnarly incident? You can page multiple teams and individuals all at once
