In an incident, at the boundaries of your knowledge and need help to figure something out? We've all been there.

With [incident.io](http://incident.io/) , you can use `/incident escalate` **to** **directly page users in Slack** — no need to log in to PagerDuty, search around and find the right place!

You can also use the PagerDuty integration to attach related PagerDuty incidents, pull information onto your timeline, and even auto-create incidents from PagerDuty!

## Setting Up

You can connect PagerDuty to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) in just a few clicks.

1. **Go to Settings >** [Integrations](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations)

3. **Fetch your API key from PagerDuty**

You'll need to create an API key by heading to your PagerDuty account, and navigating to **Integrations > API Keys**

**If you can't see the API Access Keys menu item** , you probably don't have access to create API keys in PagerDuty.

Click **Create an API Key**

- Call it " [incident.io](http://incident.io/) "

We **do** need write access, so leave the 'read-only key' box unchecked!

Copy the key to your clipboard.

4. **Paste the API key** from your clipboard into the incident.io modal

5. **Choose your bot account**

All escalations will originate from the email of the chosen account. This is unfortunately a **limitation of the PagerDuty API** . When you create an incident, it must always be associated with the email of a valid PagerDuty user, as bots (i.e., us) are not allowed to create incidents on their own.

If you'd rather not have incidents attached to a user's email, you could create a dedicated account in PagerDuty and connect that to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) . However, be aware PagerDuty will charge you for the extra seat. ​

Alright, you're all set up with PagerDuty!

## Escalating an incident

Just head over to the incident's Slack channel and hit `/incident escalate` .

**Who can I page?**

- *An escalation policy* : a way to notify on-call users about an incident that relates to a service or system, and have the right people notified at the right time.
- *Any user on PagerDuty* : sometimes, you know that special someone that can help you out when you get stuck. Escalate to them directly, and bring them in to help.
- *Both the above at once!* In the middle of a particularly gnarly incident? You can page multiple teams and individuals all at once

## Things to know

All escalations will originate from the email of the user that you selected when connecting PagerDuty to your [incident.io](http://incident.io/) account. This is unfortunately a **limitation of the PagerDuty API** . When you create an incident, it must always be associated with the email of a valid PagerDuty user, as bots (i.e., us) are not allowed to create incidents on their own.

If you'd rather not have incidents attached to a user's email, you could create a dedicated account in PagerDuty and connect that to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) . However, be aware PagerDuty will charge you for the extra seat.

**We now support auto-creation of incidents from PagerDuty.** [Take a look](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/alerts-and-automatic-incident-creation)

## Catalog

When you install the PagerDuty integration, we also sync data from PagerDuty in to the catalog so that you can set up Workflows and other automations that use it. Installing the integration will create the following types and attributes in the catalog:

**PagerDuty User**

- Name
- Email
- Role
- Job title
- Timezone
- [incident.io](http://incident.io/) User (we match based on the email)

**PagerDuty Team**

- Name
- Description
- Members (this links to the PagerDuty User type)

**PagerDuty Service**

- Name
- Description
- Status
- Escalation policy (this links to the PagerDuty Escalation Policy type)
- Teams (this links to the PagerDuty Team type)

**PagerDuty Priority**

- Name
- Description

**PagerDuty Escalation Policy**

- Name
- Description
- Teams (this links to the PagerDuty Team type)

The PagerDuty Priority type is synced daily, the other types are synced hourly.

## FAQ

**When will incident.io automatically acknowledge the PagerDuty incident?**

We auto-acknowledge incidents when:

- Someone manually goes "Yes, that PD incident *is* related to this incident"
- When a triage incident is accepted

Once triggered, we check:

- If the PagerDuty incident has already been acknowledged, do nothing
- If the actor doing the trigger action is not a human (e.g. a workflow), we do nothing
- If the human was not paged by this escalation (or we can't match them to a PD user), we do nothing. In this case, we post a message with a button saying "want to acknowledge this?"

If all those conditions pass, we acknowledge the incident and add a note saying "Automatically acknowledged via [incident.io](http://incident.io/) ", and link to the incident. We then best-effort send a message to the user, saying "We've acknowledged PagerDuty incident … for you".

**Can I control which services or escalation policies sync with incident.io?**

Yes! For any given service, you can add `incident-io-ignore` anywhere within the description and we'll no longer pull this into our platform.

Similarly for an escalation policy you can add `incident-io-ignore` as a tag.
