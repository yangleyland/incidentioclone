After your incident is over, it can be useful to dig into what happened in an incident, why, and how it can be prevented in the future.

Our Notion Integration allows you to export post-mortems into Notion. Which you can then use to collaborate with your team.

## Installation

Go to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations) , find "Notion" and click "Install".

It's important to know that when the integration is installed, the connection to incident.io will belong to **the user who installed it** . Notion connections like this, which use OAuth, belong to a specific user — for this reason, you may wish to set up a dedicated service or "bot" account.

Click "Install in Notion", and you'll be redirected to the install flow within Notion. Review the permissions we're requesting, and click "Next"

We also need to install a template for the pages we create. Click "Use a template provided by the developer", and then "Allow access"

## You're done

Congratulations, it's been installed

You'll find the page in your private Notion space – move it to somewhere that suits you, and that can be accessed by everyone.
