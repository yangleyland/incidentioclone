Still running into issues when trying to integrate Confluence to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) via our Atlassian Marketplace app?

No worries! This can be sorted but the trick here might be that you need to hit **Get it now** twice - below is a recording outlining this step-by-step:

1. Visit our [Atlassian Marketplace listing](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1233901/incident-io?tab=overview&hosting=cloud) .
2. Click on " **Get it now** " to install our app into your Confluence site.
3. Select the Confluence site and hit the " **Review"** button.
4. You should see the Review and install section with permissions required, where you will need to hit the " **Get it now** ".
5. You should see the [incident.io](http://incident.io/) app in this page, click on the row to expand it, then click on the " **Get it now** " button once more.
6. Select the Confluence site and hit the " **Review"** button again to get to another set of permissions where you'll need to click on the " **Get it now** " button another time.
7. A pop-up should display in the bottom left-hand corner outlining the progression of this - once it's completed and you see the message [incident.io](http://incident.io/) *completed successfully* hit the " **Manage apps"** button.
8. Click on the **Take me there** redirect option to land on the Connected Apps section where you need to search for [incident.io](http://incident.io/) -> hit " **View app details"** for the **Confluence** one. *Note* : *you might find two similar results containing the Jira one as well, but in this case the focus is on the Confluence one.*
9. On the redirected page make sure you hit the three horizontal dots next to the " **Uninstall"** button, which is another button called " **Get** **started** ".
10. You will be navigated to a page with a " **Link an incident.io organisation** " button. Click on it and you will be navigated to the [incident.io](http://incident.io/) dashboard.
11. Within [incident.io](http://incident.io/) dashboard, verify the [incident.io](http://incident.io/) organisation that you'd like to connect to is correctly selected. Hit the " **Connect** " button.

Integration completed
