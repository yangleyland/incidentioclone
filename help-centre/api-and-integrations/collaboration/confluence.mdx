## Getting started

## 1. Add Confluence as your document destination for post-mortems

Within the [Post-Mortem setting tab](https://app.incident.io/settings/post-mortem) , add Confluence as your document destination by clicking 'Add destination'.

2. You can then configure the default destination for your post-mortems - we'll then create post-mortems as children of the page you select. This will be the default destination for your post-mortems.

Can't see the page destination you are looking for? You can simply search the page name in the drop-down to find the right one!

You can create different post-mortem destinations for different teams or services by adding further destinations.

When you go to create and export a post-mortem, you can choose the correct destination depending on the team or service. Your default post-mortem destination will be used if you don't select a different destination!
