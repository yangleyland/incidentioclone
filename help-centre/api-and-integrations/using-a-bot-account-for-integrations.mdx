**What are bot accounts?**

Bot accounts are dummy accounts on the system you wish to integrate with, allowing you to connect integrations with your systems without them being attached to a specific user. ​ ​ **When should you use bot accounts?**

Bot accounts are recommended to be used with any of our third-party integrations that require you to Authenticate via a user's account.

**When Bot accounts are recommended:**

For example, with our [Jira integration](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/jira) you are prompted to give permissions for incident.io to take action on Jira's side.

In this case, utilizing a Bot account would be useful to ensure that regardless of company user changes, the integration will continue to work as expected and not be tied to a specific user that would cause the integration to fail if that user leaves the company.

**When are bot accounts not needed:**

In the case of **Opsgenie** [integration](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/alternative-on-call-management-solutions/opsgenie) , we ask you to set up an API key on the account and copy-paste it into our settings page, which is globally set to the **Opsgenie** account and is not tied to a user, so no Bot account is needed as the integration will not lose permission if the user leaves the company.

**Challenges of not Using Bot Accounts**

The user account used for the integration gets deactivated:

- This would cause the integration to break as the user is no longer an active user in the third-party app, causing disruption to your incident management process.
