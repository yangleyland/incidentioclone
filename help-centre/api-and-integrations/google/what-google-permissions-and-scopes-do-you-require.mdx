## Google Meet

For reading the details of participants of incident calls so we can display them in incident channels and the Dashboard, we require:

```plaintext
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/meetings.space.readonly
```

## Google Calendar

For creating debrief events and inviting people to them, we require:

```plaintext
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events
```

## Google Drive

For exporting post-mortems to Google Drive, we require:

```plaintext
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
```

## Listing users

We need to be able to join Google users back to incident.io users. For example, this enables us to invite the right "Jane Smith" to the debrief event, or resolve them to a participant on an incident call. We need to list users to do this, which requires:

```plaintext
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly
```

We also need the [dedicated service account or "bot" user](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/google-calendar) you connected the Google Calendar/Meet integration with to be an Admin who can read the directory for these features to work. Here is what the permission set requires:

## Transcribing Calls

We don't require any additional scopes or permissions for our transcription feature with Google Meet.
