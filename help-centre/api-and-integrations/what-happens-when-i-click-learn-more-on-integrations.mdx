## Overview

The Grafana integration allows you to connect your Grafana instance to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) to automatically create incidents from Grafana alerts, enrich alerts with organizational context, and attach dashboard screenshots to incidents for faster debugging.

## What you can do with Grafana

Once connected, you can:

- Create incidents automatically from Grafana alerts by setting up alert sources
- Attach dashboard screenshots to incidents to provide visual context during response
- Enrich alerts with attributes using labels on your Grafana alert rules to map to services, teams, and other catalog types
- Sync telemetry dashboards to your [incident.io](http://incident.io/) catalog for easy reference

## Connecting Grafana to incident.io

**Prerequisites**

Before connecting, you'll need:

1. Grafana API URL - The hostname of your Grafana instance (e.g., [acme.grafana.net](http://acme.grafana.net/) )
2. API Key - A Grafana API key with the following permissions:
  1. Read permissions for dashboards and folders
  2. For older Grafana versions: Dashboard modification permissions

**To create an API key in Grafana:**

1. Navigate to Configuration > API Keys in Grafana
2. Click Add API Key
3. Give it a descriptive name like " [incident.io](http://incident.io/) Integration"
4. Set it to Admin role (or at minimum, read access to dashboards)
5. We recommend creating a non-expiring key to avoid connection issues

**Connection steps**

1. In [incident.io](http://incident.io/) , go to Settings > Integrations
2. Find Grafana and click Connect
3. Enter your Grafana API URL and API Key
4. Click Connect to Grafana

Once connected, [incident.io](http://incident.io/) will validate the connection by attempting to access your Grafana instance.

## Setting up Grafana alert sources

Alert sources allow you to automatically create incidents from Grafana alerts.

**Creating an alert source**

1. Go to Settings > Alert Sources in [incident.io](http://incident.io/)
2. Click Create Alert Source
3. Select Grafana as the source type
4. Configure your alert source settings (name, routing rules, etc.)
5. Copy the webhook URL provided (it will look like [https://api.incident.io/v2/alert_events/grafana/\{alertSourceId\}](https://api.incident.io/v2/alert_events/grafana/%7BalertSourceId%7D) )

**Configuring Grafana to send alerts**

1. In Grafana, navigate to Alerting > Contact points
2. Click Add contact point (or edit an existing one)
3. Select Webhook as the type
4. Paste the [incident.io](http://incident.io/) webhook URL
5. Under Authentication, select Bearer Token and paste the token provided by [incident.io](http://incident.io/) *Note: For older Grafana versions, you may need to use HTTP Basic Auth instead*
6. Save the contact point

**Alert grouping options**

When configuring your alert source, you can choose how Grafana alert groups map to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) alerts:

- One alert per group (recommended) - Creates a single [incident.io](http://incident.io/) alert for each Grafana alert group, keeping related alerts together
- Individual alerts - Creates separate [incident.io](http://incident.io/) alerts for each alert within a Grafana alert group

---

## Dashboard screenshots and telemetry

You can configure [incident.io](http://incident.io/) to automatically attach screenshots of specific Grafana dashboards to incidents. This provides visual context during incident response.

**Selecting dashboards**

1. Go to Settings > Integrations > Grafana
2. Click Configure to open the integration settings
3. In the Connected Dashboards section, paste a Grafana dashboard URL
4. Click Add Dashboard to discover and connect it
5. The dashboard will now be available for use during incidents

**What gets synced:**

- Dashboard name and description
- Folder location
- Individual panels within the dashboard

**How dashboard screenshots work**

When an incident is created from a Grafana alert:

- [incident.io](http://incident.io/) can automatically generate and attach a screenshot of related dashboards
- Screenshots include the relevant time range around the alert
- Individual panels can also be captured and shared

---

## Enriching alerts with tags

You can tag your Grafana alert rules with labels that map to [incident.io](http://incident.io/) catalog types (like services, teams, or custom catalog types). This automatically enriches your incidents with the right context.

**Adding tags to Grafana alerts**

1. In Grafana, edit your alert rule
2. Add labels in the format \{catalog-type-name\} with the value being the catalog entry name

*Example: Add a label service with value payment-api*

1. When this alert fires, [incident.io](http://incident.io/) will automatically:
  1. Look up the service catalog type
  2. Find the entry named payment-api
  3. Attach it to the incident

**Common catalog types to use:**

- service - Link alerts to specific services
- team - Route to the right team
- Any custom catalog types you've created in [incident.io](http://incident.io/)
