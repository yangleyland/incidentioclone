## Why would you use this feature?

It's possible for us to pre-fill the debrief event so that it will be created in a specific Google Calendar.

This means that if you always expect debriefs to be scheduled in a shared calendar such as `Incident debriefs` , we'll default to creating the event in that calendar rather than the calendar of the user who's scheduling the event.

## How do I set it up?

In order for this to work successfully, your responders need to have:

1. Permission to create events in this calendar
2. Subscribed to this calendar within Google Calendar

## 1. Permissions

To ensure that everyone has the correct permission, you'll need to click the three dots next to your calendar and choose `Settings and sharing` .

Under the `Share with specific people or groups` section, hit `Add people or groups` . Then you can choose a user group (such as `engineering@incident.io` ), and you'll need to select the `Make changes to event` permission from the dropdown.

## 2. Subscriptions

Unfortunately every user needs to subscribe to this calendar manually. We prompt users to do this when they click `Schedule debrief` from within our app. We'll point them to [this article](/help-centre/status-pages/public-status-pages/setting-up-sub-pages) for getting set up.
