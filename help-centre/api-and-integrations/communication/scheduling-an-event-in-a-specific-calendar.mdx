## What should this look like?

When you're successfully set up, you should be able to schedule an event within a specific shared calendar, such as `Incident debriefs` :

## What if I don't see this?

There are two reasons you might not be able to do this:

1. You're not subscribed to the calendar
2. You don't have the correct permissions to create an event within this calendar

### 1. Checking you're subscribed

Head to Google Calendar. If you can see the calendar you're required to create the debrief in in the sidebar (under `Other calendars` or `My calendar` ), you are successfully subscribed.

If you cannot see the correct calendar, copy the calendarID we provided in the app.

Then head back to Google Calendar and hit `+` next to `Other calendars` and choose `Subscribe to calendar` . Paste the calendar ID here.

### 2. Checking you have the right permission

Click the three dots next to the specific calendar and choose `Settings` . You'll have the correct permission if it says you can `Make changes to events` . If you see something else, you'll need to ask the calendar owner to grant permission to you (or more helpfully, your whole user group) - instructions are [here](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/scheduling-debriefs-in-a-specific-calendar) .
