## Context

Organizations may want to connect multiple accounts from the same integration type (such as Sentry, GitHub, Notion, or Google) to their incident.io organization, particularly when different teams within the organization use separate accounts for these services while wanting to maintain a unified incident management system.

## Answer

Currently, we support connecting only one account per integration type per organization. This means, for example, you can only have:

- One Sentry account connection
- One GitHub account connection
- One Notion account connection
- One Google account connection

There is no current functionality to connect multiple accounts from the same integration type. If your organization has teams using different accounts for these services, you'll need to choose one primary account to integrate with incident.io.
