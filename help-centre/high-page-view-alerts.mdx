[incident.io](http://incident.io/) can send you alerts when your status page is receiving a higher number of views than normal.

This integrates with our alerts and triggers system, meaning that you can configure what actions we should take when we detect that this is happening.

## When will you alert me?

[incident.io](http://incident.io/) will send you an alert when we notice your status page has had an average amount of views that are three standard deviations higher than they would be in a normal 15 minute window.

In order for your page to be eligible to receive alerts it has to:

- Have been live for more than four days
- Have a custom domain attached
- Have not had a status page incident updated in the last 15 minutes

## How can I turn this feature on?

High page views is listed as an alert source in the triggers section of the product - there you’ll be able to choose what to do when you get an alert like this.

You can see the triggers that apply to this status page in by going to Status Pages, clicking Settings, then “Page views”.

If you don’t have a trigger that applies, you’ll be guided to create one.

Once you’ve created a trigger that applies to your status page, it’ll show in this section.

If you want to see all your triggers, click to the “Alerts” section and you’ll be able to all triggers that apply to all alerts.

## How can I turn this feature off?

You can set a trigger to ignore alerts which have the source “Status Page Views”; this means that when an alert is created, your trigger won’t cause it to be escalated.

You can see the triggers that apply to this status page in by going to Status Pages > Settings > “Page Views”.

Either edit the trigger so it doesn’t apply to this alert source, or delete it all together.
