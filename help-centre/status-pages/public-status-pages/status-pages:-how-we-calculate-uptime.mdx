Uptime is the amount of time that a component (ie. API, website) is available and working properly. The possible statuses for components are:

- Full outage
- Partial outage
- Under maintenance
- Degraded performance
- Operational

To calculate uptime, we consider how much time is spent in a status that we consider "down".

Component statuses considered "down":

- Full outage
- Partial outage

Component statuses considered "up"

- Under maintenance
- Degraded performance
- Operational

The uptime percentage is the percentage of a given time period that the component is in a status we consider "up". For example, if a component is operational between 09:00am at 09:10am, then degraded performance from 09:10am to 09:40am, then full outage from 09:40 to 10:00am, its uptime percentage from 9am to 10am would be 66% (40 minutes ‘up’ and 20 minutes ‘down’).

When displaying aggregate uptime for a group, we consider only components in it which are configured to display uptime. A group is only considered "up" if all components in it are in an "up" status.
