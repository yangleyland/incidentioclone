If you wish to restrict who can publish incidents and updates to your status page, you can achieve this with a custom role.

This lets you manage who can:

- publish new incidents
- publish updates to existing incidents
- schedule maintenance windows
- publish updates to maintenance windows
- modify the impact timeline of incidents and maintenance windows

All of this is managed via the 'Publish to status pages' permission:

By default, the 'responder' role allows anyone in your Slack workspace to update your status page. Learn how to configure this in our [article on customising permissions](/help-centre/account-admin/permissions/can-we-set-different-user-permissions) .
