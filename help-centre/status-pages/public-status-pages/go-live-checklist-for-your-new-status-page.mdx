You've got your new status page set up and looking great. There's a few things to double-check before you're ready to go live.

## 1. Link your policies

There's two important policies to link to from your status page: your privacy policy, and your terms of service.

These are particularly important if you're allowing your customers to subscribe to updates from your status page, since they'll govern how those messages will be delivered, and how customers can unsubscribe.

We suggest that you chat with your organisation's legal team first, but your organisation's standard privacy policy and terms of service, usually found in the footer at the bottom of your main website, should suffice.

## 2. Enable search engine indexing

There's two main ways for your customers to find your status page: via a direct link, or via a search engine. To get your status page appearing in search results, you'll need to enable search engine indexing in the settings page:

We'd recommend adding a link to your status page from your own website too.

## 3. Set up a custom domain

Using your own domain name for your status page helps your customers know they're in the right place. We'd recommend using `status.your-domain.com` .

There's three steps to getting this set up:

First, enter the domain you'd like to use and click 'Save':

Next, log in to your DNS provider and configure the necessary records. You'll need to set a `CNAME` , which directs traffic to our servers.

You might also need to set a `TXT` record: this is a security measure to verify that you own the domain. You can remove this record once the domain is verified.

When you're done, click 'Check'. We'll make sure the DNS records look correct, and then start serving your status page on the custom domain.

## That's it!

You're ready to go live!
