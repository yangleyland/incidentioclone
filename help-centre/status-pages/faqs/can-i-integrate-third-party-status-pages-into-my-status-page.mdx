It's fairly common for folks to to display the status of third-party services (like AWS, GitHub, Slack, or Okta) on their incident.io status page to give their users a complete view of service health, including dependencies.

Currently, incident.io status pages do not support direct integration with third-party status pages. This means you cannot automatically display the status of external services like AWS, GitHub, or other vendors' status pages within your incident.io status page.

As a temporary workaround, you can:

1. Use email alert sources to ingest status page subscription emails from third parties
2. Declare incidents based on these alerts
3. Update your status page accordingly (you can also always consider [automating these updates](/help-centre/status-pages/public-status-pages/automatically-publishing-to-your-status-page)  )

A third-party status page integration is a frequently requested feature that we're considering for development. If you'd like to add your vote, just let us know at [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io)
