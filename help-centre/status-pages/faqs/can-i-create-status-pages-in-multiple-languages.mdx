When managing incidents and status pages, you may need to communicate with customers in different languages. This includes both the status page interface and incident notifications.

## Answer

Currently, built-in multi-language support for status pages is not directly available. However, you can implement multi-language functionality through third-party translation services:

- [Unbabel](https://unbabel.com/)
- [Localize](https://localizejs.com/)

To implement translation services:

1. Sign up with either Unbabel or Localize
2. Set up your translation preferences in their platform
3. Send us the JavaScript widget for your status page at help@incident.io and we'll do the rest (see [Localize documentation](https://help.localizejs.com/docs/quickstart-for-web) for an example)

<Info>

Important notes:

- Email notifications for status page updates are currently only available in one language / cannot be translated
- Status page updates themselves can only be in a single language, so consider writing translated versions of the message in the same single update.
- Third-party translation services may incur additional costs
