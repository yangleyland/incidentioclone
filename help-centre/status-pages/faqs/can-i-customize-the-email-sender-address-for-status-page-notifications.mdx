## Context

It's often desirable to be able to customize the "from" email address for status page notifications and subscription confirmations to use a custom domain instead of the default [no-reply@status.incident.io](mailto:no-reply@status.incident.io) address.

## Answer

Currently, all status page email notifications are sent from no-reply@status.incident.io and this cannot be customized. However, you can configure a reply-to email address that subscribers will be directed to when they reply to incident notifications.

Here's what you need to know about status page email notifications:

- All status page emails will be sent from no-reply@status.incident.io
- You can set up a custom reply-to email address for incident notifications:
  1. Go to your status page settings
  2. Navigate to the Subscriptions section
  3. Enter your preferred reply-to email address
  4. Click Save
- The reply-to address will only work for incident notification emails, not for subscription confirmation emails
