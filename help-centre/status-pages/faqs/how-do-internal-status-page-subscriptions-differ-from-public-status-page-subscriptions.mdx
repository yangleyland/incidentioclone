The core concept is similar – you hit “Subscribe” and you’ll be kept in the loop – but the mechanism and options differ because of the audience:

- **Internal page:** Only available to people inside your organization. When they subscribe, [incident.io](http://incident.io/) will confirm how they want updates (Slack, email, or both if supported). Once subscribed, they are automatically following all incidents on that internal page. So if a new incident is added to the internal page, they’ll get a Slack DM and/or email about it immediately, and they’ll get every update posted to any incident on the page. They can manage subscriptions via the page (for instance, if they want to stop following a particular incident, they might do so on the page or by a link in the notification). Internal subscriptions are great for roles like Customer Success or Leadership who need to know every time a high-priority incident is happening and evolving.
- **Public page:** Available to anyone (customers, end users). When someone subscribes on a public page, they will usually need to confirm their email (to ensure it’s a valid subscription). They can choose to subscribe to the whole page (meaning any incident/maintenance event postings) or drill down to specific components. Public subscribers won’t get Slack DMs (since they are outside your Slack), but they will get emails. They also have the RSS option. Managing public subscriptions (unsubscribing or changing preferences) is typically done through links provided in the notification emails or on the status page itself.

In short, internal subscriptions leverage your company’s communication channels (Slack) and assume you want **all the things** , whereas public subscriptions are more controlled as not every incident needs to be communicated to external stakeholders.
