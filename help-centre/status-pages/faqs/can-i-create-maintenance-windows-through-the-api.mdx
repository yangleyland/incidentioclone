Currently, maintenance windows can only be created manually through the status page interface. There is no API available to automate their creation.

To create a maintenance window:

1. Navigate to your status page settings
2. Select the "Maintenance" tab
3. Click "Schedule Maintenance"

Important notes about maintenance windows:

- Maintenance windows are only available on external and customer status pages
- Internal status pages do not support maintenance windows
- For internal communications, you can create an incident and publish it to your internal status page as a workaround

<Info>

Support for creating maintenance events via the API is being tracked as a feature request. If you'd like to add your vote, just let us know as [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io)
