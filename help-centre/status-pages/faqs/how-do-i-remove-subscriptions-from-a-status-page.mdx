I am trying to manage my subscription list for my status page on [incident.io](http://incident.io/) but I can't find where in the settings I can remove subscribers from my status page.

## Answer

At the moment, there isn't a way for customers to remove individual subscribers from status pages. Since subscriptions are opt-in from users, a particular user has to choose to unsubscribe from your page.

If you're a user who is looking to remove their subscription from the status page, you can do so by finding any status page related notification/email and clicking "Unsubscribe" If you have any special circumstances, please email [support@incident.io](mailto:support@incident.io) and we can take a look!
