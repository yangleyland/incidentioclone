## Context

When migrating from another status page provider to incident.io, you may want to transfer your existing subscribers to ensure continuous service monitoring for your users. This article explains how to import your subscriber list.

## Answer

While there isn't a self-service import feature, our support team can help import your subscribers. Here's how to migrate your subscribers:

1. Export your subscriber list from your current status page provider into a CSV file
2. Ensure the CSV contains:
  - Email addresses of confirmed subscribers
  - If applicable, component subscriptions for each subscriber
3. Contact our support team with your subscriber list at help@incident.io

<Info>

Important notes about the import process:

- Subscribers won't receive any confirmation emails during the import
- The import is silent and seamless - subscribers will only receive notifications for future incidents
- We recommend performing the import as the final step of your migration to avoid duplicate notifications if running two status pages in parallel
