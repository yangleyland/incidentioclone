</Info>

The status page displays uptime and incident information for services over a default 90-day window. However, you may want to view metrics for different time periods, such as the last 30 days or a specific calendar month, particularly for SLA compliance monitoring.

Currently, it is not possible to adjust the time window on the status page from the default 90-day view. The status page shows a fixed 90-day lookback period for all services and environments.

<Info>

This feature has been logged as a future enhancement request. While there are no immediate plans to implement adjustable time windows, we understand this functionality would be valuable for SLA monitoring and reporting purposes.
