Currently, incident.io status pages cannot be managed through Terraform or automated through code. All status page management must be done manually through the incident.io interface.

While API access for status pages is not currently available, this functionality is being considered for future development.

<Info>

Support for using Terraform to configure status pages is being tracked as a feature request. If you'd like to add your vote, just let us know as [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io)
