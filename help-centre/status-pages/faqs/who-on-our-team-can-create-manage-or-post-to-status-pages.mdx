By default, creating or configuring status pages is an administrative function in [incident.io](http://incident.io/) . Typically, **workspace admins or owners** have the permissions to create new status pages, adjust settings (like components, domains, etc.), and delete or archive pages. Regular team members (responders) usually cannot create a new status page without the appropriate role permission.

However, once a page is set up, incident updates to that page can be made by incident responders (for example, an incident commander can publish updates to a public status page during an incident) – you wouldn’t want only admins to be able to post updates, since that would bottleneck communications.

So the model is generally: admins set up and maintain the page configuration, whereas **incident leads or communication leads can publish updates** to the page during an incident.

The specific roles and permissions can be fine-tuned in [incident.io](http://incident.io/) ’s settings (for instance, you may define which user roles are allowed to publish to a status page).
