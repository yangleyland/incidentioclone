It's often desirable to want to share system performance metrics (like response times, uptime statistics, or other monitoring data) directly on your status page to provide transparent performance insights to users.

## Answer

Currently, system metrics integration (such as response time graphs, performance data, or monitoring tool statistics) is not natively supported on incident.io status pages. This means you cannot display metrics from monitoring tools like Pingdom, Datadog, or other providers directly on your status page at this time.

You can still use the status page to:

- Display current system status
- Create and display scheduled maintenance events (for external status pages)
- Notify subscribers about incidents and maintenance

We will notify customers when system metrics integration becomes available.
