## Context

Users may want to receive incident updates and notifications through WhatsApp or SMS messaging services to stay informed about ongoing incidents.

## Answer

Currently, incident.io does not have an integration with WhatsApp or SMS for sending incident updates. While we collect product feedback about this potential integration, you can use our existing notification channels:

- Slack
- Email notifications
- Web interface

We track feature requests and will notify customers if WhatsApp integration becomes available in the future.
