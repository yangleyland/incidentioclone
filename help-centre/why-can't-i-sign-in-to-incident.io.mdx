You're seeing this article because you tried to sign in to an incident.io organisation which belongs to a "community" Slack workspace. Signing in using this workspace has been disabled, to prevent you from mistakenly signing in to the wrong incident.io account.

If you believe this is a mistake, please get in touch.
