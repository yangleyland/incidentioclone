If you're unsure what happened with an alert, like why an alert didn't create an incident, or if it was grouped into other incidents, you can now see the lifecycle of an alert from the alert details page.

The alert timeline offers you details on the activity of an alert and how it has been actioned. It will include things like:

- When did the alert fire
- When did the alert resolve
- What incident did it create
- What incident(s) was it marked unrelated to
- What incident(s) was it grouped into
