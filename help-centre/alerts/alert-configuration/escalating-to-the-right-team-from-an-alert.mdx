Now that you have [Alerts sources](https://app.incident.io/~/alerts/sources) set up, and have [extracted all your desired data](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/faqs/extracting-json-alert-data) from the Alert JSON payload, such as Team, Status, etc. We can use this data to:

1. Set catalog-backed custom fields 2. Escalate to a team's escalation path 3. Announce to the team's Slack channel and so much more

In this article, we'll focus on escalating to the responsible team so that only the team responsible for a certain area will be notified, ensuring that the right people are involved from the beginning of an incident.

## Setting the right attribute resource type

Before we can set these attributes, let's take a closer look at the "Team" Attribute. The return type of this attribute should be "Team" [Catalog](/help-centre/configure-your-account/using-the-catalog) type, this is what will allow us to navigate to different attributes such as escalation path, Slack channels, and more.

## Escalating to the right escalation path

In the [Alert route](https://app.incident.io/~/alerts/routes) , you can use these attributes to set values of custom fields, for example, by setting the "Responsible Team" custom field.

Furthermore, you can use the value that was set by this attribute to navigate to this team's escalation path, by taking advantage of the Catalog mapping.

Using the "Account" value that was exacted from the alert source, we can set this value in the custom field by using the catalog entry alias.

That's It!! You have now successfully set a custom field and escalated to the right Team's escalations path by extracting a data point from your alerts payload, setting it to the Team's custom field, and navigating to their escalation path

<Warning>

This will only work if your Catalog type has aliases set for each of their entries.
