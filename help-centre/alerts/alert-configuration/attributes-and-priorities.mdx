## Attributes

Alert attributes are how you extract a consistent format of data from your different alert sources, to use in your alert routes.

For example, your Grafana alerts might have a `team` label, while BugSnag alerts have `service` and `customer` tags. Attributes allow you to convert these into a consistent format, so your alert routes don't have to think about where an alert has come from.

Attributes also help responders understand alerts more quickly: rather than having to read through the whole payload, they'll see the extracted attributes first, so they can quickly understand what's going wrong and who's affected.

We have a more detailed end-to-end guide on getting started with **Alerts** [here](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/alerts-and-automatic-incident-creation) .

## Required attributes

If you have attributes that you rely on to handle your alerts correctly, you should make them required. A common use case for this is when setting a **Team** - if an alert is missing this value, then it may not be escalated and nobody will get paged.

<Warning>

Marking alert attributes as required is global configuration, so you should only do this for attributes which you expect to be set on every alert.

</Warning>

We'll then be able to warn you if your alert sources don't have this attribute configured correctly. We can also notify you if we detect alerts that are missing a value for this attribute.

You can enable required attributes and opt in to missing attribute notifications in the [Alert Attribute settings](https://app.incident.io/~/alerts/configuration/attributes) .

## Priorities

To use priorities in the escalation path branches, you can create them in [Alert](https://app.incident.io/~/alerts/configuration/priorities) [Attribute settings](https://app.incident.io/~/alerts/attributes) .
