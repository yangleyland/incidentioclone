Suggested follow-ups are given when an incident is resolved. We look back through the channel and spot anywhere follow-ups were discussed. We then match these against actions and follow-ups that are already created.

If we spot any that we think are missing we’ll bring them up as suggestions within the channel. You can then easily create follow-ups of the back of these suggestion.
