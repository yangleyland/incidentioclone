While your team are focused on the incident, how do you ensure you communicate progress accurately, and in a timely manner?

Suggestions uses AI to help teams communicate better during incidents by automatically drafting updates, summaries and follow-up actions based on your incident activity.

## Suggested updates

An incident update is a crucial point in time in an incident, where you can communicate the current progress of an incident, and context of a change in state (i.e. changing status or severity).

We will monitor your incident activity, and nudge your incident responders when the time is right, to share an update with your internal stakeholders.

The update we propose will be generated from all recent meaningful incident activity and chat context, to make sure we capture the soul of the moment.

If you believe the time is right *now* , you can still request a suggested update there and then by talking to incident with:

> @incident draft me a new update

## Suggested summaries

Once an update has been shared, we will then proactively suggest a new incident summary, to help keep participants aligned with the current state of an incident.

We take a collection of information drawn from the incident and use AI to help pull out the important information for you such as the problem, the impact, anything that may have caused it, and the next steps to that will be taken to help resolve it.

Overall, this means your incident summaries are more up to date and in a standard format - allowing newcomers to quickly understand where the incident is and help out.

If you want to draft a new summary at any time, the option is still available to request from incident with:

> @incident draft me a new incident summary

## Suggested follow-ups

Suggested follow-ups are given when an incident is resolved. We look back through the channel and spot anywhere follow-ups were discussed. We then match these against actions and follow-ups that are already created.

If we spot any that we think are missing we’ll bring them up as suggestions within the channel. You can then easily create follow-ups of the back of these suggestion.

## Configuring suggestions

Suggested summaries and follow-ups are available to Team, Pro and Enterprise customers. They are "on" by default. To check if they are enabled, head to Settings > Suggestions.

Suggested updates are available to Pro and Enterprise customers, and can also be configures from Settings > Suggestions.

## FAQ

### What's a rule based suggestion?

Rule based suggestions (previously "nudges") allows your team to build custom suggestions that can prompt incident responders to take action, based on a set of configurable rules.

To learn more about rule based suggestions and how to configure, see [Nudges](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/nudges) .
