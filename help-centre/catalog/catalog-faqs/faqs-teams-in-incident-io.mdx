## Should I manage teams in settings, or in Catalog?

You can manage teams and their members in Settings → Teams, or directly in Catalog.

The only exception is the **Escalation paths** attribute: we set this for you, based on which escalation paths have been attached to each team.

If you add additional attributes to your teams, such as their team Slack channel, you can only manage these in Catalog.

<Info>

If you're managing your team type in code (for example with [catalog-importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer) , or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest) ), you won't be able to edit teams in the incident.io dashboard at all, since we can't keep your catalog-importer or Terraform config in sync.

## How are incidents filtered by team?

Incidents are filtered by a team custom field. When you sign up, we'll create an "Affected teams" custom field automatically, and filter on this field by default.

You can change which field we use to filter incidents by team in [Settings → Teams → Configure](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/teams/configure) .

If you don't have a team custom field you can read how to set one up in our [guide to Catalog-powered custom fields](/help-centre/configure-your-account/using-the-catalog)
## How are alerts filtered by team?

Alerts are filtered by a team attribute. When you sign up, we'll create a "Team" attribute automatically, and filter on this field by default.

You can change which attribute we use to filter alerts by team in [Settings → Teams → Configure](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/teams/configure) .

If you tag your alerts by service, you can add a team attribute which gets set based on which team(s) own the service for the alert. See how to configure alert attributes in [our guide here](/help-centre/alerts/alert-configuration/attributes-and-priorities)
## Can I filter escalations by team?

Escalations aren't filtered by team. You can navigate from either alerts or incidents to escalations.
