**What is an enum?**

Enums are a way to better support categorical attribute types. This allows you to create child catalog types from a parent catalog type.

```plaintext
{
      outputs: [
        {
          name: 'Teams',
          description: 'Team in org',
          type_name: 'Custom[\"Teams\"]',
          source: {
            name: 'goal',
            external_id: 'external_id',
          },
          attributes: [
            {
              id: 'description',
              name: 'Description',
              type: 'Text',
              source: 'description',
            },
            {
              id: 'email',
              name: 'Email list',
              source: 'emails',
              array: true,
              enum: {
                    name: 'List of emails',
                    type_name: 'Custom["ListOfEmails"]',
                    description: 'List of all team members',
                  },
            },
            {
              id: 'name',
              name: 'Goal',
              type: 'Text',
              source: 'goal',
            },
          ],
        },
      ],
    },
```

In the sample above a `Team` catalog type will be created with `name` , `description` , and `email` attributes. The `List of emails` attribute will be created as a child attribute catalog type from the parent `Teams` .

#### Why does this matter?

Having child catalog types for these attributes allows workflows to know which options that attribute supports and gives you a drop-down instead of being textual.
