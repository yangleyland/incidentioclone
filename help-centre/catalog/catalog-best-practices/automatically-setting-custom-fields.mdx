It can be useful to automatically set custom fields to reduce the mental overhead for your responders.

## Common use cases

**1. Speed up responders**

Using [Catalog](/help-centre/configure-your-account/using-the-catalog) , it's possible to 'guess' what the right value is for a custom field. For example, if the affected service is `Data Pipeline` , the affected team is **probably** `Data` . The Catalog can figure this out for you, without the responder having to fill in yet another dropdown during the incident.

**2. Improve reporting**

If you're a larger org, you might have hundreds of teams. When it comes to reporting and insights, it's often useful to cut the data in a less granular way: perhaps by **Division** or **Function** .

To enable this, you can create another custom field `Affected Functions` and use the Catalog to automatically set this based on the `Affected Teams` field that the responder has set above.

You would never even need to show this field to a responder, but it would then be available for you to slice and dice data going forwards.

## How to create an automated custom field

When creating a Custom Field, select Automated, and then Add an expression.

Then, use the Expression Builder to navigate through your Catalog to automatically derive a Custom Field based on the value of another Custom Field.

You can also decide whether users are able to override the value of the custom field. For our `Affected teams` use-case, we probably do want users to be able to choose another value - this is more of a 'sensible default'.

However, for our `Affected functions` use-case (i.e. for reporting) there's no need: there's always a consistent relationship between team and function.
