Our pay calculator provides a quick and easy way to pull compensation for your on-call responders without having to manage internal tooling and scripts to do the same.

This help article will walk through two different approaches in how you can calculate pay using:

1. Single pay configuration
2. Multiple pay configurations

To get started, you'll need to head over to the 'Pay calculator' tab within the On-call section of [https://app.incident.io](https://app.incident.io/) . Friendly reminder that only On-call customers will be able to use the calculator to generate reports!

## Single pay configuration

For most organizations, leveraging a single pay configuration will suffice as it supports those that pay *all* of their on-call responders the same rate.

To generate a report, you will need to first create a pay configuration via the 'Configure' button on the top right.

From here you can set your pay configuration to include all the rules for paying your on-call responders, including:

- Currency to be paid in
- Holidays
- Daily or hourly pay rates
  - For example, if you pay £10 / hr every day, except Monday - Friday 9am - 5pm during working hours, this would look like:

Once you have set your pay configuration rules, you can create a new report. Steps to generate a report include:

1. **Settings** Please create a name and specify the time range for your pay report (ie. the past month)
2. **Schedules** Here you can select any schedules that should receive compensation for being on call.
3. **Payments** Within Payments, you should select 'Same pay rules for everyone' and then select the payment configuration you set to apply to the report.
4. **Holidays** Please check that you have accounted for any holidays that require additional or different payment. You can either import public holidays from our tool or you can manually add (useful if you have separate company holidays!).
5. **Generate** Once you've completed all the above steps you can generate your report in a draft state so you can review before finally publishing!

## Multiple pay configurations

Now, if your organization pays on-call responders different rates depending on different factors, you will want to generate a report using multiple pay configurations. Examples of this include:

1. Location-based compensation

1. Role-based compensation
2. Tier 1 vs Tier 2 engineer compensation

We will walk through a location-based model below, but the approach will apply to any of these types of scenarios.

To start, you will need to set up all your different pay configurations via the 'Configure' button on the top right.

So, for a location-based model, you may want to set up configurations as such:

- Team United Kingdom
  - **Currency** : £
  - **Timezone** : London (GMT)
  - **Hourly pay rates** : £10 / hr every day, except Monday - Friday 9am - 5pm during working hours
  - **Holidays:** United Kingdom

- Team USA
  - **Currency** : $
  - **Timezone** : New York (EST)
  - **Hourly pay rates** : $15 / hr every day, except Monday - Friday 8am - 6pm during working hours
  - **Holidays:** United States
- Team Australia
  - **Currency** : AUD
  - **Timezone** : Melbourne (GMT+10)
  - **Hourly pay rates** : $10 / hr every day, except Monday - Friday 9:30am - 5:30pm
  - **Holidays:** Australia

Next, you will want to go to the Catalog and connect Users to an Office. This is how you will be able to connect the pay configurations to the appropriate on-call users during report generation.  So, for example, I can make connections that look like so:

- Anna is in the Melbourne Office
- Sarah is in the NY office
- Ben is in the London office

To do this, you will need to create a Catalog type, such as **Office** , with different name values and associate the Users with those locations. Then in the User catalog type, create a derived attribute called Office that has the path **Office > Users** .

*Note: If you need additional help working with the Catalog, please refer to help content* [here](/help-centre/configure-your-account/using-the-catalog)
Once you have set your pay configuration rules *and* have connected locations to users in the Catalog, you can create a new report. Steps to generate a report include:

1. **Settings** Please create a name and specify the time range for your pay report
2. **Schedules** Here you can select any schedules that should receive compensation for being on call.
3. **Payments** Here you should select 'Different pay rules for different groups.' From here you will want to use If expressions to connect Users -> Office -> Pay configurations. See screenshot for an example of how this can be set up:
4. **Holidays** Please check that you have accounted for any holidays that require additional or different payment. You can either import public holidays from our tool or you can manually add (useful if you have separate company holidays!).
5. **Generate** Then you can generate your report in a draft state so you can review before publishing!

We also have a helpful Loom to walk you through this type of report generation, which you can find [here](https://www.loom.com/share/05d4d78fdcfa41e9915d3a9d078d8055?sid=0410146b-74fd-4ee7-892a-c745dbb35eec) .

## Additional tips for generating reports

1. **Deduplication:** If you have users that are on-call for multiple schedules at once, and want to deduplicate payments, please select 'Pay only once for overlapping shifts' while generating a report.
2. **Create using old report:** You can create a new report based on a previous one (which will reuse the same schedules and pay configurations so you don't have to reselect everything each month!).
