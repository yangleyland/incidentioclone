Once an incident has started to be announced, the announcement settings at the time it was announced will persist for the duration of that incident, regardless of any subsequent changes to the announcement rule configuration. This is to provide continuity in the announcing of an in-flight incident e.g. if you stop announcing an incident because of a configuration change to an announcement rule, it can result in confusion as it's then not clear what the outcome of that incident was. This same logic also applies in the context of announcements being triggered from workflows.
