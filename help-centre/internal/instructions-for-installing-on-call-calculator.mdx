## Initial Setup



To install, head to [app.incident.io](https://app.incident.io/) . You'll be asked to 'Sign in with Slack'. We'll create an account for you and store some basic information, like your name and avatar.

You'll then be asked to 'Add to Slack'. When you've done this, we'll create an #incidents channel, and install the app into your workspace. At this point, everything should be ready to go.
