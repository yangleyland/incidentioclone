If you need to [give incident.io privileged Slack access](/help-centre/installing-incident-io/what-does-incident.io-need-privileged-slack-access-for) , we recommend creating a Slack account just for that purpose, because:

- channels created by this user will still say 'Created by incident.io', keeping things nice and clear
- if this user is invited to private incidents, it will not expose private data to anyone, since no one should log in with this Slack account
- this user will receive 'channel archived' notifications for all incidents

Neither incident.io nor Slack will charge for this account. Slack does not charge for accounts that have not been logged in to for more than 14 days (see their [fair billing policy](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218915077-Slacks-fair-billing-policy) ). This type of account is sometimes referred to as a 'service account' in Slack's documentation.

Here's how to create a Slack user for incident.io:

1. **Create a new user in Slack**

Follow Slack's latest guide [here](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-workspace) . We recommend using an email list address, such as `it+incidentio@example.com` .

2. **Accept the invitation**

Make sure to set the name to "incident.io Admin", so it's clear to everyone what the account is for.

3. **Upgrade the account's role**

Log in as a Workspace Owner or Admin and upgrade the new account's role, using [Slack's guide](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/218124397-Change-a-member%E2%80%99s-role#manage-owner-and-admin-roles) .

4. **Connect the user to incident.io**

Make sure you're logged in to Slack with the `incident.io Admin` account, then open your [Security settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/security) and click "Connect" next to "Privileged Slack access".
