## The problem

When logging into incident.io after clicking the "Sign in with Slack" button, you see this error: `no_bot_scopes_requested`

This happens when you're attempting to login with a Slack Enterprise (a.k.a. Organisation), as opposed to a Slack Workspace.

## The solution

To fix, you should click the drop-down in the top right, and pick a Workspace, instead of an Organisation. For example, "Aloha Pizzas" is a Workspace. Whereas "Pineapple Enterprise" is an enterprise
