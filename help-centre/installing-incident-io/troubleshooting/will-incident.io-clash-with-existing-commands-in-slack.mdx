<Tip>

You can find a cheatsheet with all of the `/inc` commands [here](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/shortcuts-cheatsheet)  .

</Tip>

Our Slack application has two slash commands: `/inc` and `/incident` . They both work in the same way, and are a quick and powerful way of interacting with incident.io from within Slack channels.

For example: `/inc eu-west-1 is down` will let you declare a new incident, `/inc help` will take you to a quick "command picker" and `/inc action restart the database` will let you quickly add a new action.

Slack only lets one application listen to a particular command. If you have an existing application that has registered `/inc` or `/incident` as slash commands, then these will start to be handled by incident.io when you install us to Slack.

Installing us into Slack won't remove the other application from Slack. Multiple applications can define the same slash commands, and the most recently installed app "wins". If you're migrating from a Slack application that uses `/inc` , and wish to install our app without disrupting that, you'll need to re-install that application after you have installed incident.io.

You can read more about commands and shortcuts in [the Slack documentation](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/help/articles/360057554553-Use-shortcuts-to-take-actions-in-Slack) , and [their API documentation](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands) goes into even more detail.
