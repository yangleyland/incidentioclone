## Why am I having this issue?

In order to provide the best experience for managing incidents, we need to be able to create channels inside your Slack workspace. There's two types of channel that we create:

1. The main `#incidents` announcement channel. This is created during install, and is used as a place to announce new incidents as they happen.
2. Individual `#inc-...` channels, which are created whenever you declare a new incident, and used to coordinate your response.

As channel creation is a core feature of the product, we'll prevent you from installing us if we detect workspace settings that'll prevent us from working correctly.

## Fixing the problem

*You'll need a workspace admin to do this!*

There are two options:

1. **Allow all workspace members to create channels**

Head to your Slack workspace settings:

Make sure the *People who can create public channels* setting is set to *Everyone except guests.*

That's it! Select " *I've changed channel creation permissions* " and complete your installation

2. **Use an admin account to create channels**

If you'd like to keep your channel management settings, you can connect a Slack admin user that we'll use to create and manage incident channels.

We recommend creating a new user account just for incident.io, because the connected user will appear to be taking actions within Slack, which can cause confusion. For example, this user:

- will be the "channel creator" for all incident channels
- will appear to archive incident channels

If you've set "people who can create private channels" to either "workspace admins and owners" or "workspace owners only", you will need to connect a Workspace Owner account to use [private incidents](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/can-we-mark-incidents-as-sensitive-and-restrict-access) . The connected user will:

- be invited to all private incident channels
- will appear to remove participants whose access has been revoked
- will appear to archive the incident channel

Once you've created this user, make sure you're logged in to Slack as that user in your browser, then select " *I'd like to use a Slack admin user* ", and click " *Continue* ".
