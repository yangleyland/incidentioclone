There are just **3 steps** :

1. Sign Up (via Slack)

2. Select your integrations

3. Add incident.io to Slack

<Info>

**A couple of notes** *You will need a Slack admin to install us due to Slack's permissioning model.* *The app uses* `/inc` *and* `/incident` *as slash commands. If you already have an app installed or install one after ours that uses either of these commands* , *then just note that Slack will default to using the most recently installed app when that command is run.*

## 1. Sign Up (via Slack)

From the [sign-up page](https://app.incident.io/) , you'll be asked to ' *Sign in with Slack* '.

We'll create an account for you and store some basic information, like your name and avatar. We'll also ask for a restricted set of permissions in order for [incident.io](http://incident.io/) to work. Read more in our [Security FAQs](https://docs.incident.io/security-faqs) .

## 2. Select your integrations

This is just so we get a sense of the most-used tools in our user base. We explain how to set up your integrations → [here](/help-centre/api-and-integrations) .

## 3. Add incident.io to Slack

Last step: ' *Add incident.io to Slack* '.

When you've done this, we'll create you an #incidents channel, and install the incident.io app into your workspace.

...all done! ️

**Everyone in your Slack workspace can now use** [incident.io](http://incident.io/) **** — they simply need to go through the same ' [Login with Slack](http://app.incident.io/) ' flow. They will not be asked to ' *Add incident.io to Slack* ' - that step only happens once.

Let's go declare some incidents!
