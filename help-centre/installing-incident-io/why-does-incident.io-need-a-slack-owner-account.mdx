If you've connected a Slack admin account for privileged Slack access, but you're seeing this message, here's how to resolve it:

## Why am I seeing this message?

There's two reasons you might see this message:

1. **We need privileged Slack access to manage private incident channels.**

To manage private incident channels, the connected Slack user must be a Workspace Owner. We'll never automatically invite Slack Admins to private incidents.

2. **Your workspace settings restrict actions to only Workspace Owners**

If your workspace settings are set to "Workspace owners only", the connected admin account won't be able to take those actions. Check out our [guide to privileged Slack access](/help-centre/installing-incident-io/what-does-incident.io-need-privileged-slack-access-for) for more information on these workspace settings.
