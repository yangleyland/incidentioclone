</Info>

[incident.io](http://incident.io/) offers On-call notification support for: mobile app, SMS, phone call, Slack and email. Depending on your country, the availability of some notifications, more specifically telecommunication notifications, may vary due to local regulations, carrier restrictions, etc.

This document will share the latest information on country deliverability support for our notification channels.

Last updated on **Thursday, July 31st, 2025.**

<Warning>

[incident.io](http://incident.io/) **strongly** recommends that the mobile app is the primary notification method for getting paged. While we provide SMS and phone notifications as well, factors like local carrier restrictions and government regulations can occasionally make it harder to receive or respond to these particular notification formats.

</Warning>

## Mobile app notifications

The mobile app is currently supported worldwide, with a few limited exceptions. These exceptions include countries facing US sanctions, or lack of Apple Store or Google Play Store presence. These countries include:

- China
- Cuba
- Ethiopia
- Iran
- North Korea
- Sudan
- Syria
- Uzbekistan

As a reminder, we strongly recommend that the mobile app is the primary notification method for On-call notifications and supplements any SMS or phone notification rules.

## SMS and phone call notifications

Please see below for country deliverability. Support is broken out to the following:

- Full support - This means the country allows for full SMS or phone call support including delivery and acknowledgement
- Partial support - This means the country may either have limited deliverability due to carrier restrictions, local government regulation and/or, for SMS notifications, lack of ability to acknowledge via SMS
- No support - This means the country has no support for these notification methods

<Info>

If you do not see your country below, please ask us about our deliverability there via [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io) . It is likely either we have not had users in that country yet or we have not been asked directly about that country's deliverability.

</Info>

<Info>

If you see the country you need as only partially supported, please check with our team to determine what that means more specifically (ie. is it simply just unable to acknowledge via SMS or are there certain carrier restrictions to be aware of).
