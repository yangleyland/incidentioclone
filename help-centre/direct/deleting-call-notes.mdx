If you need to delete the call notes / transcripts that [incident.io](http://incident.io/) records from your incident calls, for example to purge sensitive content, you have two options:

## 1. Manually delete call notes

When you open the call notes on an incident page, you can delete them via the "three dots" menu on the upper right:

## 2. Automatic deletion

You can also configure your call notes to be automatically deleted either 14 or 90 days after the call ends. This can be set in the Scribe configuration (on the AI configuration page).

## What happens when my call notes are deleted?

When we delete call notes via either of the above methods, we:

- **Permanently delete** the raw transcripts and the names of the speakers
- **Archive / "soft delete"** the other information generated from the transcripts, namely:
  - Summaries
  - Current topics
  - Key moments
