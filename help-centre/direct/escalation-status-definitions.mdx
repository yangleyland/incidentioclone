## Background

There is a lot of terminology used in the on-call space that can have different meanings depending on the paging provider you use. In this help article we aim to clarify how alerts and escalations, common on-call terms, mean in the world of incident.io On-call.

## Alerts vs. escalations

Most importantly, alerts and escalations are different things! Within incident.io On-call, an alert is an event or issue that can trigger an escalation.

An example scenario:

*An event (alert) fires from Datadog (alert source) and pages (escalation) the person on-call.*

### Alerts

An alert will include details about the event or issue, including:

- Alert source (e.g. Datadog, Sentry)
- Alert attributes (e.g. team, feature)
- Timestamps
- Deduplication keys
- Status (see more details below)
- and more

See an example alert:

An alert can only be one of two different statuses:

- `Firing` - This means there is an event or issue that is currently ongoing and needs to be addressed.
- `Resolved` - This means the event or issue no longer exists, or that the alert has been addressed. An alert can be resolved automatically from the alert source or manually in our dashboard or mobile app.

### Escalations

An escalation will include information about who was paged. An escalation could be created automatically from an alert or from a manual escalation (ie. `/inc escalate` or `/inc page` ). Escalation information can include:

- Who was paged / notified
- How users were paged / notified (e.g. email, mobile app, Slack, SMS, phone)
- Alert source
- Alert route
- Escalation path
- Timestamps
- Statuses (see more details below)

</Frame>

- An escalation can be any of the following statuses:
  - `Pending` - This is the state before an escalation has started notifying anyone. You can configure an escalation to wait before paging people
  - `Triggered` - This is when an escalation is actively triggered, is actively moving through levels, and is not yet acknowledged
  - `Canceled` - If the escalation isn't actively acknowledged, but some other event means it shouldn't progress, such as the attached alert being resolved.
  - `Acknowledged` - An escalation has been ack’d by someone on the escalation path. Acknowledged escalations won't escalate to any further levels or new users, but will continue to page any existing users that haven't yet acknowledged via their chosen contact methods
  - `Resolved` - An escalation that has been acknowledged, and is no longer paging anyone. This occurs when all users have acknowledged, or when a single user has acknowledged, and the escalation time to acknowledge has passed.
  - `Expired` - This means that an escalation has finished running through the entire escalation path, and any determined retries, but has gone unacknowledged

## Important things to note

Two important things to remember with alerts and escalations are:

- You **cannot acknowledge an alert** , only an escalation.
- An **alert can only be resolved** , either manually within incident.io or automatically within the alert source.

## Resolving alerts

To help clarify how alerts work in practice, below are ways that you can resolve an alert within incident.io:

1. **Manually resolving an alert within the dashboard or mobile app** If you go to the Alerts section in the dashboard or mobile app, and go to an individual alert, you can resolve that alert. This can be found in the top right of the alerts detail page, such as:
2. **Manually resolving an alert from Slack or Microsoft Teams** If you send alerts to a Slack or Microsoft Teams channel via an alert route, similar to the dashboard, you can resolve that alert directly from Slack or Microsoft Teams.
3. **Alert resolves itself at the source** This means that the alert coming from an alert source has auto-resolved and we are now reflecting it’s most common state. Things to note:
  - Some sources like Grafana cannot be manually resolved. This is because they send us an event when the issue is resolved, without any intervention required.

## Routing alerts

Alert routes let you configure what should happen to escalations (and incidents) they create, if the alert resolves. You can:

- **Auto-cancel escalations if alert is resolved** Within the alert route - you can auto-cancel escalations if the alert is resolved.
- **Auto-decline triage incidents if alert is resolved** This is a feature available on the alert route. If the alert resolves before moving into a ‘true’ incident, we will auto-decline the triage incident.
- **Resolved escalations** This is a *status* for escalations, in addition to: pending, triggered, acknowledged, cancelled, expired or *resolved* . One thing to note is if you page multiple people on a level, the escalation will remain "acknowledged" until everyone on the level responds (either with an acknowledge or nack), which it then changes to “resolved.”
