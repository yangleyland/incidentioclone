</Info>

We're in the process of building out [AI SRE](https://incident.io/ai-sre) , and as part of that work are requesting new permissions for our GitHub app.

The new permissions we're requesting are **Contents: Read** .

This will power our ability to find problematic code changes that might've caused incidents, and suggest them in the incident channel as the root cause.

In order to do this well, we need to see the contents of pull requests - enabling this permission will give us the visibility we need.

**You don't have to accept the new permissions**

If you don't want to accept these new permissions, it's completely fine to deny the request.

Your GitHub integration will not be affected in any way - it will work just like it does now!

If you have any questions at all, please drop us a line at [support@incident.io](mailto:support@incident.io) . ​
