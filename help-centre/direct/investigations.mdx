If you're reading this, you're part of the early access program for Investigations, and we'd love your feedback.

## What is Investigations?

Investigations is a new product from incident.io that will help you investigate and ultimately resolve incidents faster. Behind the scenes it’s a complex multi-agent system that aims to figure out what’s going on during an incident by looking at your alerts, past incidents, code changes and more.

Here's what you can expect from the first version that's currently available in early access: At the beginning of an incident, the Investigation will run an initial diagnosis based on context from your alerts. Based on the initial diagnosis, it will then analyse potentially relevant messages from Slack channels you’ve configured, all of your past incidents and recent code changes to figure out what’s going on, what the root cause is and what next steps you should take. All of that will be summarised in a message at the beginning of the incident channel in the first couple of minutes after the incident is declared.

So far we’ve found really promising results with our agents that extract learnings from past incidents, find which are relevant to the incident you’re currently responding to and use those learnings to inform the RCA and next steps the Investigation provides. You can learn more about our long term plans for Investigations [here](https://incident.io/building-with-ai/the-timeline-to-fully-automated-incident-response) .

## How can you provide feedback?

Investigations is in active development throughout the early access program, so your feedback will be instrumental in shaping it. Here's how you can help:

- At the end of each incident with an Investigation, we'll send you a DM to ask them for feedback if you were the incident lead. It's a simple form which asks if the Investigation was useful with an optional comment. Responses to this form will help us to understand where Investigations is helpful, and where it could be improved.
- Reach out to us and share feedback directly. We want to hear the good, the bad and the ugly so we can make this experience rock solid. If you're in a Slack connect channel with us that's the best place, otherwise feel free to contact me directly at edward@incident.io.
