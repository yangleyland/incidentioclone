## FAQ

**What questions can Assistant answer?**

Assistants knowledge of your incident history is powered by a single table, aggregated by incident. This table is equipped with:

- Incident IDs
- Type, Severity, Status & Mode
- Summary
- Names of the incident reporter, lead and active participants
- Timestamps for your incident lifecycle
- Custom fields
- Workload
- The number of Follow-ups & Actions completed/outstanding

This enables Assistant to answer questions like:

- What is causing incident workload in my team?
- How is median time to mitigate changing over time?
- Which teams have the most outstanding follow-ups? Does that increase mean time to resolution?

Since the data is aggregated by incident, Assistant can't answer questions on an individual basis on Workload, Post-Incident Tasks or Follow-ups.

**How do you use AI?**

Please find more details in [this article](/help-centre/configure-your-account/how-do-we-use-ai).

**How do you handle private incidents?**

No data from private incidents is accessible via Assistant.
