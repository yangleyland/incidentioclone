Configure an IP allowlist to restrict traffic to your [incident.io](http://incident.io/) workspace.

Specifically, requests to all authenticated API endpoints must originate from an allowed IP.

This includes:

- Dashboard usage
- Public API access
- Mobile app traffic

This *excludes* :

- Public alert ingestion endpoints
- Public webhook endpoints used by third parties

Requests from IPs outside the configured allowlist will receive a 403 response.

JSON 

```json
{
    "type": "resource_forbidden",
    "status": 403,
    "request_id": "g329NK8-",
    "errors": [
        {
            "code": "forbidden",
            "message": "Unauthorized"
        }
    ]
}
```

### Permissions

In order for a user to manage the IP allowlist, they must have the "Manage security settings" scope. This is configured in [Settings > Users > Roles](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/users/roles) .

Similarly, in order for an API key to manage the IP allowlist, it must have the "Manage security settings" permission.

### Configuring your allowlist

Navigate to [Settings > Security](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/security) and scroll down to "IP allowlists".

Click "Manage" to open the drawer, and enter your selection of IPv4 addresses and/or CIDR IP prefixes.

Your current IP will be pre-filled in the list. Any request to modify an enabled allowlist will be rejected if it does not contain the requestor's IP, to prevent lockout.

<Info>

Once enabled, the allowlist will immediately become active. Ensure that your allowlist is complete before enabling it.

</Info>

To enable the allowlist, enable the toggle and click "Save"

### Disabling the allowlist

Use the same toggle as before to disable your allowlist, and click "Save".

This will allow requests from all IPs to access your [incident.io](http://incident.io/) workspace.

Your list of IPs and CIDRs will remain available for future use.
