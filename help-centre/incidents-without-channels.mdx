</Info>

By default, we create a channel in Slack or Microsoft Teams for every incident as a dedicated space to collaborate and coordinate response.

We understand that for some low severity incidents, creating a channel might not be necessary - so we've introduced the flexibility to configure whether to create channels per [Incident Type.](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/incident-types)

If you realise part way through the incident that it does need a channel after all, no worries! You can manually create a channel directly from the dashboard or incident announcement.

## Setting Up

To configure this feature, navigate to Settings > [Incident Types](https://app.incident.io/settings/incident-types) .

For your chosen Incident Type, toggle on 'Skip channel creation' and optionally set extra conditions, for example only skipping channel creation for Minor incidents.

## Manually creating channels

If you decide your incident does warrant a channel after all, you can trigger channel creation from the dashboard, or the incident announcement post.
