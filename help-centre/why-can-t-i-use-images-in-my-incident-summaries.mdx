Although our summary editor supports pasting in images, we found that this caused performance issues: as these images could be incredibly large — and are accessed whenever an incident is shown, or listed.

On 25th March 2025, we introduced a change that means that we deny updates to summaries that contain images. This is to preserve the performance of the [incident.io](http://incident.io/) platform. Users will now see an error message when they try to save, and it will point them towards other features that support them.

Specifically:

- In Slack, we'll ingest any images that are posted into the channel, and these end up in the incident timeline.
- In Slack, configurable forms can be set to include a "file upload" element, and images here end up as incident attachments.
- When editing a postmortem using our in-app editor, you can upload images as evidence.

In Microsoft Teams, this is a known shortcoming: they won't be able to upload images by pasting them into the channel.
