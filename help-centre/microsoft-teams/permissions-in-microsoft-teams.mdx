incident.io for Microsoft Teams requests three sets of permissions:

1. Global permissions: these give us access to resources across your Microsoft tenant.
2. Team-specific permissions: these allow us to manage the 'Incidents' team where the incident.io bot is installed.
3. Install and upgrade permissions: optionally, these permissions allow us to automate setting up incident.io in your Microsoft account.

## Global permissions

Before you can install the incident.io app to Microsoft Teams, we first need access to view information about your Microsoft tenant.

The permissions here are for app-only access, and allow us to perform certain operations against Microsoft's API without a user being present. This is called [app-only access](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/user-admin-consent-overview#admin-consent) . When you sign up for incident.io, or when we need to add new permissions, you'll have to go through [the admin consent process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/user-admin-consent-overview#admin-consent) .

## Team-specific permissions

When you install the incident.io app for Microsoft Teams, we'll gain additional access to the Team the app is installed to, but not other Teams or Chats within your Microsoft tenant.

**Note** : these permissions only apply inside the Team that the incident.io app is installed to. No access is granted to other Teams in your account.

## Install & upgrade permissions

These permissions allow us to create the Incidents Team and install the incident.io app to it on your behalf.

We only ask for these permissions for one hour at a time, after which we won't be able to use these permissions without your explicit consent.

If you would prefer not to grant us these permissions, you can take these actions manually from within Microsoft Teams. Please get in touch and we'll help you get set up manually.
