To sign up for [incident.io](http://incident.io/) using Microsoft Teams, please visit [this](https://app.incident.io/setup-msteams/login) link.

You can read more about [the permissions we ask for](/help-centre/microsoft-teams/permissions-in-microsoft-teams) .

## Signing up

## Step 1: Sign in with Microsoft

## Step 2: Consent to permissions

We need these permissions to identify you, so you don’t need to tick “Consent on behalf of your organisation”.

## Step 3: Select a plan

Select a plan that would be a good fit for your organisation. This will help us connect you with the right people on our team.

## Step 4: Grant “global permissions”

You must be a Microsoft admin to proceed with this step. If you'd like [to learn more](/help-centre/microsoft-teams/permissions-in-microsoft-teams) about our permissions, we have an article.

This is the first of two steps that both look fairly similar, beware!

## Installing our Teams app

## Automatically

**Step 1: Grant us temporary permissions**

In this part, we temporarily ask for permission to create a new “Incidents” team in Teams, and install our app to it. This may take a few minutes.

## Manually

If you don't want to give us permission, or your Microsoft tenant doesn't allow us to install the application automatically, then:

1. Create a new "Incidents" team — or choose a team you wish to reuse.
2. Right click on the team, and choose "Manage team".
3. Go to the "Apps" tab and click "Get more apps".
4. Search for "incident.io" and click through to our listing.
5. In the "Add" dropdown, click "Add to team".
6. Choose the team to install us into.
7. Click "Set up" at the bottom right.

Once that's done, you should be able to go back to [https://app.incident.io](https://app.incident.io/) , and declare an incident.

## You're done!

There should be a new “Incidents” team with a “General” channel and an [incident.io](http://incident.io/) tab where you can declare an incident.

## Installing our Teams app into an existing team

Once you've installed our app for the first time (e.g. you have followed the [Installing our Teams app](/help-centre/microsoft-teams/installing-incident.io-in-microsoft-teams) section and have an 'Incidents' team), you're also able to install us into other teams in your Teams workspace.

By installing incident.io into your other teams, you'll be able to:

- Declare incidents from the incident.io tab from within that team
- Create [Announcement rules](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/can-we-change-where-incidents-get-announced) to send incident updates to that team

To add our app to another team:

1. Choose a team you wish to add us into.
2. Right click on the team, and choose "Manage team".
3. Go to the "Apps" tab and click "Get more apps".
4. Search for "incident.io" and click through to our listing.
5. In the "Add" dropdown, click "Add to team".
6. Choose the team to install us into.
7. Click "Set up" at the bottom right.
