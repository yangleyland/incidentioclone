1. Go to [portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com/)
2. Go to "Enterprise applications"
3. Find the [incident.io](http://incident.io/) app
4. Check the "Sign-in logs" and "Access reviews" sections for information about why the sign-in failed. Your admin may be able to help you fix these issues, and the information here can help us figure out what's wrong
