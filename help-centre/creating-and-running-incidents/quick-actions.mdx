Quick Actions are a helpful tool for getting your incident response off the ground quickly. These actions often represent the first steps needed in an incident such as assigning key roles, escalating to an expert, or joining an incident call in progress.

In this article, we will show you how to create you own custom Quick Actions.

1. You can find the [Quick Actions](https://app.incident.io/settings/slack-channel) in Slack Channel section of your settings.

2. To create a new quick action, click the "+ Add new button", or edit an existing action by clicking the pencil icon. When you create a new Quick Action, you will be asked to choose between a Pre-Defined or Custom Link quick action.

- **Pre-Defined** Quick Actions come from our list of useful actions.
- **Custom Link** Quick Actions allow you to create a quick action that links you to URL, maybe to an internal document or a useful tool.

In this example, we are going to choose the Pre-Defined option, and the Type 'Make me Comms Lead'.

3. You can add a condition to limit when this Quick Action appears. For this example, we will only use this Quick Action when the incident severity is critical. We can configure that by adding a condition to our Quick Action.

4. Now, when you declare a critical incident in Slack, you will be given with the 'Make me Comms Lead' quick action.
