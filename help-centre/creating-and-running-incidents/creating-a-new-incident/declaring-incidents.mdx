Something has gone wrong, and we need to respond!

There are 3 ways to kick-off a real incident (you can create [test incidents](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/can-we-run-fake-incidents-to-sandbox-incident.io) if you want to run experiments and do dry runs without affecting production incidents!).

## 1. In Slack use /incident (or /inc)

From any channel in Slack, typing `/inc` or `/incident` and hitting `Enter` will pop up the incident creation form.

*Tooltips*

- If you know your incident's title/summary, you can type extra text directly at the end of the `/incident` to pre-fill the incident form's " *What's going on?* " field (e.g. `/inc Website is down` )
- Using `/incident` in a dedicated incident channel (the `#inc-...` ones) won't declare an incident, but instead will open up a menu of actions on that specific incident (e.g. change the severity, update the Statuspage etc.).

## 2. In Slack turn a message into an incident

You just need to hit the 3 built-in dots on a Slack message and click 'Create an incident' 👇🏼 (we explain [how to do this in-depth](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/can-we-create-incidents-or-actions-from-an-existing-slack-message) )

## 3. In Teams use the incident tab

In Teams, head to the General channel in the Incidents Team (where your incidents are announced) and click on the incident.io tab to find the incident declare form.

## 4. Use inc.new in your browser to create an incident

Here you can create a new live or [retrospective incident](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/can-i-create-retrospective-incidents) .

Just fill out all the details of the incident you're declaring, and it will be declared in Slack too!

Regardless of which method you choose, we'll trigger a form asking for some basic information about the incident - all totally [customisable](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/customizing-your-incident-creation-form-using-custom-fields) !

*In the heat of the moment, you don't even need to fill out the form before hitting* `Create` *: by default, we'll kick off a low-severity incident with a randomly generated name (both the name and severity are easy to change later via* `/inc rename` *and* `/inc update` *).*

We'll also tell your team about the new incident via the incident announcements channel ( `#incidents` by default, but you can [change the announcement rules](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/can-we-change-where-incidents-get-announced) ).
