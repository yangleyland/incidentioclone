Yes - it's very simple!

- Go to the incident slack channel
- Use the command `/inc update`
- Update the incident status to the relevant "open" status

You can also do this within the dashboard. Just head to the incident's homepage and click *Share update.* You'll then see the pop-up shown below where you can re-open the incident.

## If your incident channel has been archived:

- Go to the slack channel
- Go to settings
- Unarchive the channel
- Then complete the above steps!
