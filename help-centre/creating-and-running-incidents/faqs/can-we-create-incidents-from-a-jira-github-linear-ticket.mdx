Yes and no (famous last words)

We currently do not have the ability to create incidents off the back of Linear tickets (if this is something that you want, [get in touch](http://incident.io/community) !). For example, if you log a bug into a Linear board and wish to escalate that ticket into an incident, there is no way to do this from incident.io.

However, where there is a will there is a way, right?

As a temporary hack, you could **funnel your Linear tickets into a dedicated Slack channel, and 'Create an incident' from there** , like so👇🏼
