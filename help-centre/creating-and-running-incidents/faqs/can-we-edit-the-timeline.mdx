Yes! Our timeline is completely customisable. We generate a simple timeline based on key events, but you can always add your own narrative or events that happened in an external system.

→ Check out [this article](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/generating-your-incident-timeline) for a full walk through of how to do this.
