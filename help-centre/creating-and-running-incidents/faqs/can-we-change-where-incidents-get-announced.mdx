Absolutely!

By default, we'll announce new incidents and updates in the `#incidents` channel.

However, if you have an **existing channel you'd like to use** (e.g. `#engineers` ), or want to **add some conditional announcements** (e.g. announce critical incidents in `#customer-support` too), you can.

1. **Go to Settings >** [Announcements](https://app.incident.io/settings/announcements)

2. From there, you can **re-direct all announcements** to a different channel to `#incidents` , and also **create a new announcement rule** for any specific incident types or severities that you'd like to call out in a separate channel

Make sure not to delete whichever channel you are using for default announcements ( `#engineers` , `#incidents` or any other)!

If you already have an `#incidents` channel when you install our app, we'll create a new default channel for you called `#incident-io-incidents` which you can then rename to whatever you’d like!
