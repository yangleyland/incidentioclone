Sometimes, you just want to practice with [incident.io](http://incident.io/) without the whole company knowing, and without messing up your lovely incident library with fake data

Luckily, we support test incidents for exactly this use case!

## What is a test incident?

Test incidents are almost exactly the same as normal incidents: you can set summaries, leads, escalate to others, create [workflows](http://app.incident.io/settings/workflows) , and receive nudges.

The only differences are:

- We won't announce it publicly in any announcement channels
- It won’t appear in your dashboard in either the list of incidents, or your insights
- You won't be able to update your status page
- Workflows will not automatically run but they can be configured to run on a case by case basis within the advanced settings within a workflow

️ **Our Statuspage integration is disabled in a test incident** . This is a safety measure to avoid people updating public Statuspages when you're just trying the tool out.
