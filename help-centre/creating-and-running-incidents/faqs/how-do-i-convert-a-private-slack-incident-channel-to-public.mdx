## Context

When managing incidents in Slack, you may need to convert a private incident channel to a public one. This conversion changes the visibility of the incident channel and makes it accessible to more team members.

## Answer

To convert a private incident channel to a public one, the channel's privacy settings in Slack need to be changed. However, this action can only be performed by users with specific permissions:

- Only Slack Workspace Admins or Owners can change a private channel to public
- Regular users or channel members cannot make this change, even if they are channel admins

If you need to convert a private incident channel to public and don't have the necessary permissions, you will need to:

1. Contact your Slack Workspace Admin or Owner
2. Request them to change the channel's privacy settings to public
3. Once the channel is made public, the incident will automatically be converted to a normal (public) incident
