## Context

When managing incidents in Slack, users may want to update specific custom fields directly using Slack commands, similar to how they can update fields using Slack buttons in the interface.

## Answer

Whilst it is not currently possible to set a single specific custom field directly, using a dedicated Slack command, there are 3 approaches you can use that will help:

1. Use the general `/inc update` command to modify incident details, including custom fields.
2. View all custom fields and update using the `/inc fields` command.
3. Create a Custom Fields form [here](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/forms) to include any custom fields you regularly might want to edit on an incident, then use the `/inc customfields` command to bring this form up!
