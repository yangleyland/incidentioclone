## Context

The "Rate this incident" feature allows users to provide feedback after an incident is closed via a button that appears in the final Slack message. Understanding where this feedback data is stored and how it can be accessed is important for teams wanting to track incident feedback.

## Answer

The "Rate this incident" feature currently has the following functionality:

- A feedback button appears in Slack after an incident is closed
- Team members can provide feedback through a modal in Slack
- The feedback responses are included in exported post-mortems (to platforms like Google Docs, Notion, or Confluence), but only if the Feedback section is enabled in your post-mortem template.

Important limitations to note:

- The feedback data is not currently visible within the incident.io application interface
- The Slack modal cannot be customized
- There is no way to configure when the feedback button appears (it shows by default)
- If you use incident.io as your post-mortem location rather than exporting, the feedback will not be visible

<Info>

To view incident feedback, make sure you have enabled the Feedback section in your post-mortem template before exporting to external platforms.
