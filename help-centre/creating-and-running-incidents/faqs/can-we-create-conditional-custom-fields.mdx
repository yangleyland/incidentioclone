Want to create a [Custom Field](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/customizing-your-incident-creation-form-using-custom-fields) that only reveals itself based on a set of conditions (e.g. a specific severity field only for cyber incidents)?

Absolutely! Using [configurable forms](/help-centre/configure-your-account/configuring-incident-forms) , you can choose to hide or show a field depending on another field's value. Further details can be found [here](/help-centre/configure-your-account/configuring-incident-forms#h_b87cf099f8) .
