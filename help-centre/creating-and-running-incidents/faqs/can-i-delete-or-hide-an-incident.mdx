We feel very strongly about keeping your data safe, and preserving its integrity. As such, **we don't currently support deleting incidents** .

However, we also know it's easy to press the wrong button and pollute your data!

So, if you want to 'hide' an incident, you can **simply cancel it** from the incident's page! 👇🏼

You can also use `/incident cancel` within an incident's slack channel

Cancelled incidents won't appear in your [Insights](https://app.incident.io/insights) , and you can **filter them out in the dashboard too** .
