You might declare an incident and realise you need to hand over the Lead role (or any other custom role) to one of your teammates...only to realise you can't find them in the drop-down! Urgh, confusing right?

2 potential fixes:

1. **Type the first few letters of their name** : the users we show in the drop-down are just a selection of incident.io users, so that team member might just not be visible
2. [Invite them](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/inviting-teammates-to-incidents) **to the** `#incidents` **channel** : we don't auto-add all your Slack users into incident.io, so they might not appear because they've never been invited to incident.io before!
