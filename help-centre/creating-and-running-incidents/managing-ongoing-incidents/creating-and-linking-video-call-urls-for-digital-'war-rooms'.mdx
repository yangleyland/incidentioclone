Especially in a remote world, you'll usually want to set up a video call for incidents, to act as your online 'war room'.

There are 3 ways to do this with incident.io.

## Automatically create a call link

We can automatically generate and pin a dedicated call link for each new incident via the Zoom or Google Meet integration.

Once you've [set up Zoom](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/zoom) or [Google Meet](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/google-meet) , toggle on the `Automatically Create Incident Call` setting in the [Zoom](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations/zoom) or [Google](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations/google_meet) integration.

## Copy-pasting an existing link

If you already have a Zoom/Google Meet video call link, **paste it into an incident's (** `#inc-...` **) channel.**

We will recognise it as a call link, and ask you if you'd like to pin it as the go-to link for everyone working on the incident.

*You can also use* `/incident call` *for this* !

## Using the same fixed link for all incidents

If you have a unique call link you use for all your incidents, you can attach that link as a default from the [Automation page within Settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/automation)
