While an incident is ongoing, there are many reasons you might need to put it on hold for a moment. Whether that's waiting on a third-party to get back to you, or simply because it's outside the team's working hours.

## Why pause incidents?

Pausing an incident will clearly communicate through announcements and the dashboard that an incident is not currently being worked on.

While an incident is paused, we won't send nudges to the incident channel. Workflows configured to run on active incidents will not run until the incident is resumed.

Time an incident spends in the paused status also won't count towards duration metrics, giving more accurate reporting on when an incident was being worked on.

## How do I use it?

The `/inc pause` command allows you to pause an incident, setting the date & time it should be paused until, and a message explaining why it's been paused.

The incident will automatically be resumed at the time specified, and put into the status it was in prior to pausing .

You can always resume it before then using `/inc update` , as well as change what time it's paused until.

We've included a few handy shortcuts to pause more quickly such as

`/inc pause until tomorrow` to pause until 09:00 the following morning

`/inc pause until working hours` to pause until the nearest weekday at 09:00

`/inc pause for 45` to pause the incident for 45 minutes
