One of the most important aspects of good incident management is knowing who the key people in the room are, so you can turn to the right person for leadership and help.

With incident.io's [Roles](https://app.incident.io/settings/incident-roles) , you can easily make clear:

- What the responsibilities of a given role are
- Who is currently playing that role

## Managing roles during an incident

The easiest way to view and assign roles is to type `/incident roles` in a given incident's channel.

This will bring up a modal that shows you all of the roles that you can select from, and who's currently owning them.

*Power-user, and want to do this more quickly? You can! Type* `/inc role [role name] [@user]`

*For example,* `/inc role lead @dinesh` *sets [Dinesh] as the [Lead]. You can see what the appropriate Slack handles for other roles is* [here](https://app.incident.io/settings/incident-roles) *.*

We'll post an update into the incident's channel to make the role assignment clear...

...and we'll update the incident's announcement post to reflect the new roles

## Sending Instructions

Incidents are stressful. We want to make it easy for people that are playing a role to know what they have to do in that role.

When someone is assigned to a role, we'll **privately send instructions to the person that has been assigned to the role, letting them know what they should do** .

You can [customise those instructions](https://app.incident.io/settings/incident-roles) when you `Edit` each role.

*We'd recommend adding a short description which makes the primary responsibilities clear, and links to external documentation where people can read more.*

## Creating new roles

If you want to [create your own roles](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/creating-custom-incident-roles) , you absolutely can! The only default role in incident.io is the Incident Lead.
