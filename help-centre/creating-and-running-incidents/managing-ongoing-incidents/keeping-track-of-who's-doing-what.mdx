In the confusion of an incident, it's easy to miss (or simply forget!) who's fixing what. And once the incident is closed, we stack up to-dos during debriefs, just to find them alive and well 3 months down the line when you just 'feel like you've seen this before'...

With Actions and Follow-Ups, incident.io helps you:

- Jot down and keep track of what's being done - and who's doing it - during an incident instead of keeping it all in someone's head (usually that of the incident lead...)
- Capture to-dos and export/sync them to your issue tracker post-incident

## Capturing an Action/Follow-Up

New actions can be added in 3 ways.

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| **Slack command** `/incident action Do a thing` (to turn into a Follow-Up, simply pick ' *After the Incident* ' from the ' *When does it need to be done?* ' drop-down) |  |
| **Reacting with the** `:boom: emoji ` to a Slack message to create an action |  |
| **Reacting with the :fast_forward** `: emoji ` ` ` to a Slack message to create a follow-up |  |
| Via the **incident's homepage** in the web app |  |

When an action is created, we show the whole channel an `I'm on it!` button, allowing teammates to quickly assign the action to themselves.

## ️ Getting a quick overview of who's doing what

Key in `/incident actions` to quickly list and edit all actions/follow-ups, their status, owners, and more.

*Every interaction with your incident actions appears on your incident* [timeline](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/generating-your-incident-timeline) *, too.*

## Exporting to issue trackers

Although issue trackers are not *quite* what you need when you're looking for some fast lightweight coordination in the middle of an incident, they should be (and probably are!) your central hub for to-dos.

Once you've added the [integrations](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations) , you can export follow-ups from [incident.io](http://incident.io/) to your issue trackers ( [Jira](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/jira) , [GitHub](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/github) , [Linear](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/linear) and [Shortcut](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/task-and-issue-tracking/shortcut-(formerly-clubhouse)) presently), from the Post-incident tab

**We will sync the status of your follow-ups** , so you don't need to worry about updating that manually in incident.io!
