Want to update specific incident details (e.g. severity, status, roles, summary etc.) without broadcasting a full-blown status update?

You can do this from the incident's Slack channel ( `#inc-...` ) at the speed of light ️, with just a few handy Slack commands ( [there are more](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/shortcuts-cheatsheet) !)

**The One Command to Rule Them All** :

`/incident`

From the incident's Slack channel ( `#inc-...` ), this will make a drop-down appear of everything you need to update an incident's details.

Easy peasy lemon squeezy

For the power users out there, you can also use the following quick shortcuts:

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| Update the incident's **severity** | `/incident severity` |
| Update the incident's **status** | `/incident status` (or `/inc resolve` to directly mark a live incident as resolved) |
| Update the incident's **summary** | `/incident summary` |
| Update the **roles/lead** | `/incident roles` or `/incident lead` |
| Update [Custom Fields](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/customizing-your-incident-creation-form-using-custom-fields) | `/incident fields` |
| Update [Actions](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/keeping-track-of-who's-doing-what) | `/incident actions` |

*Some (and soon all!) details are also editable from the web app on the incident's Homepage.*
