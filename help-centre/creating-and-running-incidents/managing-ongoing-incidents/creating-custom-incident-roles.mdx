Incident Lead not enough? Want to add and create your own roles, like Incident Manager, or Communications Lead?

You can!

---

1. **Go to Settings >** [Incident Roles](https://app.incident.io/settings/incident-roles)

2. **Click** `Add Role`

This will pop up the Role creation modal

`Name`

What role are you creating? For example, ' *Communications Lead* '.

`Slack reference`

Set the Slack command that will assign this role. For example, `/inc role lead @dinesh` sets [Dinesh] as the [Lead]. The Communication Lead's could be `comms` , such that `/inc role comms @Erlich` assigns Erlich to the Communication Lead role.

`Description`

This is the sub-text that will appear to guide your team in the Roles modal.

`Instructions`

This is the instructions we'll send to the **** person that has been assigned to the role, letting them know what they should do.

`Require this role to be assigned before an incident is resolved`

When ticked , we won't allow an incident to be marked as resolved without someone having been assigned this role. This is key for debriefs and reporting/compliance.

*The Incident Lead is compulsory by default in incident.io, and thus always required.*
