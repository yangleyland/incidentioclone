Triage and active incidents can be merged into other active incidents. Read up on [how to use triage incidents](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/triaging-your-incidents) if you've not come across these before.

## How can I merge a triage incident?

In the incident channel, you'll see a message saying that the incident is in triage. If you select "Merge", you'll be asked which incident you would like to merge the incident into.

The message looks like this:

You can also do this from our Dashboard, by selecting "Share update", and then choosing the "Merge" option.

## How can I merge an active incident?

You can merge an active incident when doing an incident update (as above), or by using the `/inc merge` Slack command.

## What happens to merged incidents?

First, we update the incident to say it's been merged:

We then move across all attachments from the old incident to the new one, and then post a message into the new incident to say it has had another incident merged into it.

The old incident will no longer appear in insights, and other incident statistics.

## Do severities or custom fields get moved across?

Currently, we don't do anything with properties of the old incident (e.g. severities, custom fields) — the new incident will retain all of its existing properties.
