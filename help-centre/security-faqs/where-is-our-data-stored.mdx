</Info>

For transactional data processing (interacting with the Slackbot, and viewing the dashboard), the data is hosted in GCPs Belgium region, in [europe-west1](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#europe) . We additionally have a hot standby in the Netherlands region, [europe-west4](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#europe) .

For analytical data processing (for our internal analytical use case), data is stored [within Europe](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations) .

We currently don't send any data outside of Europe.
