## Context

You may need to delete your incident.io account or organization for various reasons, such as completing a trial period, discontinuing service, or wanting to start fresh. This article explains how to request account deletion and what happens during the process.

## Answer

Since account deletion requires administrative verification, you'll need to contact the incident.io support team to delete your account or organization. Here's how to do it:

1. If you're requesting deletion of your entire organization:
  - Ensure you are the organization owner or have appropriate permissions (and are contacting us from your registered accounts email address or Slack)
  - Provide us with your organization URL (e.g. `https://app.incident.io/your-org-name` )
  - We'll handle the deletion of your org, and cancellation of your plan
2. If you're requesting deletion of just your user account:
  - Unfortunately you can't delete your account from [incident.io](http://incident.io/) , as it's synced to your Slack profile. Whilst an org Owner/Admin can remove your permissions and set you back to just a `Viewer` role, the only way to completely delete the account would be deactivating your Slack profile.

<Info>

If you're an Enterprise customer using SCIM, you can de-provision users via SCIM

</Info>

After your deletion request is processed, you will:

- Receive confirmation from the support team that the deletion is complete
- No longer have access to the account or organization
- Stop receiving any automated emails or notifications

If you wish to use the service again in the future, you'll need to create a new account - please reach out to us if you have any questions about getting it set up, and we'll be happy to help!
