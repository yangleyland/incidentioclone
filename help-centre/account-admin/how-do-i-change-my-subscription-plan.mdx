## Context

Customers may need to change their subscription plan (upgrade or downgrade) based on their needs. The process varies depending on which plan you're moving to.

## Answer

The process for changing your subscription plan depends on your current plan and which plan you want to move to:

## Moving to Team Plan

If you want to upgrade to the Team plan:

1. First, you need to be on the Basic plan. If you're currently on Pro or Enterprise trial, contact support to downgrade to Basic.
2. Once on Basic, you can self-serve the upgrade to Team plan through your [billing settings](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/billing) .

## Moving to Pro or Enterprise Plan

Upgrades to Pro or Enterprise plans always go through sales:

1. Contact the sales team to discuss your requirements
2. They will help set up a trial if needed
3. Work with sales to finalize contract details

## Downgrading to Basic Plan

To downgrade to the Basic (free) plan:

1. Contact support to request the downgrade
2. If you've recently paid for a subscription, you may be eligible for a pro-rated refund
3. Note that downgrading will remove access to premium features like private incidents, advanced insights, incident types, SAML SSO, RBAC, call routes, and unlimited custom fields and workflows

<Info>

Important: The Basic plan has a limit of 5 responder/on-call seats. If you're downgrading to Basic, ensure you have no more than 5 active responders by changing excess users to "Viewer only" access.
