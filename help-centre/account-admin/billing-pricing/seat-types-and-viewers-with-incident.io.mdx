</Info>

Our [pricing](https://incident.io/pricing) is based on the number of Responder and On-call seats in your company, so it is only fair that you ask what counts with each seat in incident.io!

---

## Definitions: Responder seats, On-call seats & Viewers

As a rule of thumb, Responder and On-call seats are for users who actively engage with [incident.io](http://incident.io/) to be On-call, manage incidents, whereas Viewers (free seats) are users who declare and join an incident channel to contribute information, but do not actively participate in incident response.

## On-call seat (paid)

Someone with a responder seat can have the role permissions of an [Administrator](/help-centre/account-admin/permissions/can-we-set-different-user-permissions) , [Owner](/help-centre/account-admin/permissions/can-we-set-different-user-permissions) or any [custom role](/help-centre/account-admin/permissions/can-we-set-different-user-permissions) .

Users who have an On-call seat can:

- Be added to a schedule
- Be added to an escalation path
- Have access to the mobile app
  - Incidents
  - Escalations
  - Schedules
    - Overrides
    - Cover me
- Get paged via all methods (phone, SMS, Slack, app, email)
- Request cover via mobile app and Slack
- Create overrides via dashboard, mobile app and Slack
- Create pay reports from On-call

## Response seat (paid)

Viewers can only have the Standard set of permissions.

Users who have done the following will qualify as Responders:

## Viewer only (free)

If you don't have a paid response seat or an on-call seat, you can still use parts of the product as a viewer. Viewers can create an incident, observe what is happening in the incident, and post messages in the channel.

As a viewer, you can:

- Create incidents (everyone in the company can declare incidents for free)
- [Decline](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/creating-a-new-incident/triaging-your-incidents) an incident
- Join incident channels and post in them (everyone can track and contribute important information to incidents for free)
- Going through a [tutorial incident](https://incident.io/changelog/2021-12-20-tutorial) (everyone can - and should! - learn the ropes of incident.io for free)
- View alerts, escalations and schedules
- Add an [Attachment](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/how-do-i-add-attachments-to-incidents) (e.g. Zendesk, Github, etc.)
- [Escalate](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/managing-ongoing-incidents/escalating-incidents) to someone (e.g. via incident.io On-call/Opsgenie/PagerDuty)
- View [internal status pages](/help-centre/status-pages/introduction-to-status-pages)
- View post-mortems

All our plans allow unlimited viewers free of charge

## Adding and removing Responders

We will automatically graduate users who have taken any one of the actions listed earlier to Responders in your incident.io account. With On-call seats, we will specifically ask you if you want to upgrade users to On-call if you will

- Add someone to a schedule
- Add someone to an escalation path

They will only be removed from a Response and/or On-call seat if:

- You downgrade them from your incident.io account (in Settings > [Users](https://app.incident.io/settings/users) ); or
- Their Slack account is deleted.
