## Monthly billing

If you pay monthly (Team Plans only), on upgrade from basic we’ll automatically:

- Calculate your number of responders based on product usage; and
- Initially bill your card for your current in-use seats for the upcoming month
- Then, on the same day each month, we will charge you for any accrued overages or credit for downgrades, calculated on a daily basis, as well as bill you for the next month based on your seats in use on that day

---

## Annual billing

Team plan:

- You will pay 12 months based on your seats in use at the time. Any accrued overages or downgrades will be billed or credited as applicable on the same day each month.

Pro or Enterprise plans:

- You’ll decide with our helpful sales team the seats you’d like to purchase for the year based on your internal estimate and we will invoice you for this on your services start date.
- If you grow faster than planned and have more responders than you estimated, you can either choose:
  - Co-term contract with our sales team and lock in a reduced price for the remainder of your current subscription for these seats
  - Bill you at the end of each year for the **additional responders pro-rated on a daily basis**

## On-call responders

<Warning>

If you are adding users when creating schedules who don't have On-call enabled, we'll send you a confirmation modal below to ask after you try to save a schedule.

</Warning>

<Warning>

*You can* **manually remove/downgrade responders** *from the dashboard at any time if e.g. one of your responders gets promoted to a managerial oversight role, or leaves your company.*

</Warning>

- On-call responders can be purchased as with responder seats on the Team plan and you are free to add or remove as you wish.
- For Pro and Enterprise you will have a hard limit to your on-call responders and you’d need to contact our sales team to either re-contract or co-term to purchase more.
