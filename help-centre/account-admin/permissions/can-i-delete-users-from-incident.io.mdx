Not right now, though there shouldn't be any need for this: inactive Slack users (e.g. if someone left your company) will be automatically offboarded as Slack tells us they are inactive.

If you'd like this functionality, get in touch via our [Slack community](http://incident.io/community) or directly at [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io) .
