This page gives extra detail on errors that you might see when using Microsoft Teams for your incident calls.

## Microsoft Teams authentication failed

Seeing this error means that we failed to authenticate with Microsoft while creating your call. Please go to Settings → Integrations and check that your connection to Microsoft is set up correctly.

## External participants not allowed

This error can occur when Microsoft Teams calls are set up to forbid external participants. Please read [Microsoft's article on this issue](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/microsoftteams/meetings/external-participants-join-meeting-blocked) .
