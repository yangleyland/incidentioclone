This page gives extra detail on errors that you might see when using Google Meet for your incident calls, or when using Scribe to transcribe them.

## Call not found

We need to look up data about the call, in order to fetch information about the people who are participating. If you see this error, it is because we weren't able to fetch information about the current call. If the call URL was set manually, please check that the call can be accessed by the Google account that was used to connect the Google Meet integration.

## Scribe could not join breakout room

If you see this error, it is because Scribe tried to join a Google Meet call which was a breakout room. Scribe does not currently support breakout rooms.
