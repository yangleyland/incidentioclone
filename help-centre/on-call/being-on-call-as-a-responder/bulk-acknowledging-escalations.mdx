## Bulk acknowledging escalations

When you have escalations that are all related, we allow you to bulk acknowledge in the mobile app.

This is useful when you want to be focussed on dealing with the incident without getting distracted by alert that are going through the same escalation you're already handling.

## Automatically acknowledging escalations

When there are 2 or more escalations, we'll provide you with an option to let us automatically acknowledge for a given time period after you have acknowledged all alerts.

This is useful when you're already working on the problem and would like anything that comes through the same alert route to not disturb you.
