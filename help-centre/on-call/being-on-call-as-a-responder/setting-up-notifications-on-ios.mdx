**Download our mobile app**

If you'd like the best possible experience as a responder, download our mobile app [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/incident-io/id6471268530) .

</Info>

When you are paged, we'll try and contact you according to your [notification rules](https://app.incident.io/~/user-preferences/on-call-notifications) .

By default, assuming you've enabled them, this will include:

- Push notification
- Phone call
- SMS
- Email
- Slack direct message

For both push notifications, phone calls and SMS messages, there are steps you can take to ensure you get notified, regardless of what your phone's silent mode and do-not-disturb settings are set up like.

## Phone calls + SMS

1. Save the incident.io contact card to your contacts.
2. Go into the Contacts app and open the contact you've just saved.
3. Tap on `Edit` at the top and scroll down to `Ringtone`
4. Enable the `Emergency Bypass` toggle, which will allow calls and messages from incident.io to make a noise regardless of your silent or Focus settings.
5. Go back to the contact card and tap on `Text Tone` , and again enable `Emergency Bypass` to ensure that SMS messages also ring audibly.
6. Finally, we'd recommend opening [your preferences](https://app.incident.io/~/user-preferences/on-call-notifications) on the incident.io dashboard on your computer and clicking the test button next to your phone number whilst your phone is locked to verify the bypass is working. We'd recommend trying:
  1. While your phone is on silent
  2. While your phone is in do-not-disturb
  3. While your phone is in sleep mode

If you've done the above, and your phone is still in silent, first check that the phone call you received was identified with the incident.io contact details. If it wasn't, you might need to re-save the incident.io contact card.

If you haven't been phoned at all then please get in touch with support. If you have been phone, but it didn't make any noise, then please get in touch with our support team.

## Push notifications

iOS has a concept of `Critical notifications` , which are push notifications that'll make a noise, regardless of whether your phone is on silent, or if you are in sleep/do-not-disturb. The incident.io app supports these natively so as long as you agreed to these notifications during set up of the app, you'll receive them. If you did not agree to them, you'll see a warning on the home screen of the app.

To enable these notifications, open the `Settings` app on your phone, scroll down to incident.io, select `Notifications` and then enable critical notifications.

<Info>

Please note that the following settings in iOS could interfere with push notifications:

- [Announcing notifications](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/airpods/dev8c670727e/web) : if you have toggled "Announce notifications" in your incident.io app settings, sounds might go through connected AirPods or other devices when your device is locked.
- Screen Time: if you have a time limit set on your device, iOS might not deliver notifications correctly. Consider adding the incident.io app to your list of "Always on" apps.

</Info>

**Custom notification sounds**

For push notifications, you can pick a custom notification sound from Notifications > **Notification sounds** . If you want the notification to make a sound for a long time, we have notification sounds ranging from 1 second to 2 minutes long.

**Contact card**

If you're unable to provide contacts permission, you can still manually download our contact card [here](https://app.incident.io/api/mobile/responder_vcard) - however you'll need to periodically update it yourself as we may add phone numbers from time to time.
