On-call uses multiple channels (Mobile app, phone, SMS, Slack and email) to notify you of upcoming shifts and escalations.

You'll be able to use either the dashboard or the mobile app to add your contact methods and set notification rules.

## Contact methods and notification preferences

Set up all contact methods you'd like to use within the incident.io dashboard. You can find your preferences by clicking your profile and then choosing preferences.

Your Slack and email notifications should already be setup for you here by default but we'd also highly recommend adding your phone and downloading [the mobile app](/help-centre/on-call/being-on-call-as-a-responder/on-call-notifications-and-preferences) is one of the most popular contact methods when escalations arise.

After having all the methods you want to use for notifications, you can choose how we should notify you when you are on-call or are being escalated to e.g. via app, SMS, Phone Call, Slack etc.

We have sensible default rules for your notifications but you can edit those rules depending on what works best for you. For example, you can add up to 10 levels of incrementally delayed notifications.

Additionally, it's important to have reminders to know when you are about to be on-call. Below On-call notifications, you can adjust your shift change rules to ensure you remember to be ready for your next shift!

## Mobile app settings

When you have downloaded the incident.io mobile app and signed in via Slack or SAML, we will guide you to an onboarding flow to help you set up the right notifications. This will include: ​

1. Enabling Push Notifications

2. Enabling Critical Notifications

3. Saving our Contact Card on your phone

4. Verifying your phone number

5. Bypassing the 'Do not disturb' mode

Doing all the above ensures that you will not miss any important updates or notifications! You will be able to review all settings in the mobile app later on.

## Testing

After setting up all notifications and preferences, you can test that all notifications paths work. Just click "Test" on mobile or the bell icon on the web app and you should receive a test message to the right channel.

## Mobile app preferences

Additionally, you will be able to change appearance between Light and Dark mode on the settings page of the mobile app. You can also just follow the device's theme you have set up.
