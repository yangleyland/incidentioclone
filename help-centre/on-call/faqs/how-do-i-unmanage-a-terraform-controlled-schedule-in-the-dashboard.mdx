When schedules are created and managed through Terraform, they cannot be edited directly in the web UI. However, there may be times when you want to switch from managing a schedule via Terraform to managing it directly in the dashboard interface.

To change a schedule from being Terraform-managed to being manageable in the dashboard UI, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the schedule you want to unmanage
2. Click "Edit" to open the schedule's edit drawer
3. Click the "Export" button
4. Scroll to the bottom of the export drawer
5. Click the "in the dashboard" link in the callout message

Once completed, you will be able to edit the schedule directly in the dashboard interface. This allows you to make changes such as modifying the order of responders or updating schedule details without using Terraform.
