## Context

When handling incidents, users may need to escalate to different levels in their escalation path. Sometimes, the same person might be assigned to multiple consecutive levels in the escalation path, and users need to understand how the escalation feature works in such scenarios.

## Answer

The escalation button functionality is limited to the next immediate level in your escalation path, regardless of who is assigned to that level. Here's how it works:

1. When you acknowledge an escalation in an incident channel, you'll see a button to escalate to the next level
2. Before the escalation occurs, you'll be shown who will be paged and the notification message that will be sent
3. The escalation button will only appear on the original acknowledged escalation
4. If the same person is on consecutive levels, you cannot skip levels to reach a different person (such as a manager) at a higher level

Note: The escalation button will not be displayed on subsequent escalations after the initial one, even if the same person acknowledges multiple levels.
