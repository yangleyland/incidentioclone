Android supports [work profiles](https://support.google.com/work/android/answer/6191949?hl=en) , which allow users to separate work applications from personal applications.

When setting up our mobile app in a work profile, it is best to follow these steps:

1. Sign into work slack in the browser, outside of our app (i.e: log in at https://app.slack.com)
2. Sign in using our app, which will use the session already in the browser, from step 1.
