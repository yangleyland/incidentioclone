You can also add more contact methods and change how you want to be notified about upcoming shifts.

## 3. Request cover and create overrides

Managing your shifts is simple through the **web dashboard** , mobile app, or Slack/MS Teams.

- **Create an override** to swap out your scheduled shift
- **Send a cover request** to ask another team member to cover your shift

## 4. Acking a page

When you receive a page, you can **acknowledge** it through any method. This lets you jump straight to the incident channel and start investigating.

If you have multiple escalations for related issues, you can **bulk acknowledge** them in the mobile app. Read more about bulk and auto acking [here](/help-centre/on-call/being-on-call-as-a-responder/bulk-acknowledging-escalations) .
