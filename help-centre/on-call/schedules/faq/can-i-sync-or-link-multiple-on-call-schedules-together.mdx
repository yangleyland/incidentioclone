## Context

Organizations often need to coordinate multiple on-call schedules, such as having primary and secondary on-call rotations, or syncing schedules between different teams. Common scenarios include: - Having primary and secondary on-call rotations with the same team members - Coordinating schedules between related teams (e.g., Engineering and DevOps) - Ensuring the same person isn't scheduled for multiple rotations simultaneously

## Answer

Currently, schedules operate independently and cannot be automatically linked or synced with each other. Each schedule needs to be managed separately.

Here are the available options for managing multiple schedules:

1. **Manual Schedule Management** : Create and maintain separate schedules, being mindful to manually check for conflicts when making changes or adding overrides.
2. **API Integration** : Use the [Schedules API](https://api-docs.incident.io/tag/Schedules-V2) to:
  - Monitor for scheduling conflicts
  - Create automated checks for overlapping assignments
  - Build custom logic for schedule coordination
3. **Escalation Paths** : For primary/secondary coverage, use escalation paths with different schedules.

**Note:** The platform is working on enhanced team-first approaches to on-call configurations which may provide better schedule coordination capabilities in future updates.
