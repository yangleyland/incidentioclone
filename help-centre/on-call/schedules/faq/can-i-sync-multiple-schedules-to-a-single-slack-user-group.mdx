## Context

When managing on-call rotations, teams often want to sync multiple schedules (such as primary and secondary on-call, or Level 1 and Level 2 support) to a single Slack user group. This would allow team members to notify all currently on-call personnel using a single @mention in Slack.

## Answer

Currently, it is not possible to sync multiple schedules to a single Slack user group. When setting up schedule sync with Slack, you can only connect one schedule per user group.

Here are some alternative approaches you can consider:

- Create separate user groups for each schedule (e.g., @primary-oncall and @secondary-oncall)
- Use a single schedule with multiple rotations instead of separate schedules
  - Each rotation can represent different groups (e.g., primary and shadow rotations)
  - Note: This approach may not work if you need different escalation paths between the rotations

This functionality has been noted as a common feature request, and the product team is tracking this need for future consideration.
