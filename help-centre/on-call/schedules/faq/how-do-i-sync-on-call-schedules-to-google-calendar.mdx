## Context

Teams often need to sync their on-call schedules with Google Calendar to improve visibility of upcoming shifts and help team members plan ahead. This can be particularly useful for teams who want to share on-call schedules with their colleagues or maintain better visibility of their upcoming on-call responsibilities.

## Answer

You can sync your on-call schedules to Google Calendar directly from the Schedules page. Here's how:

1. Navigate to your schedules page
2. Look for the "Sync Calendar" option at the top right of the schedule
3. Click on it to configure your calendar sync preferences

Important notes about calendar sync:

- You can choose to sync all shifts in a schedule, not just the ones you're assigned to
- The sync will include shifts for the next 3 months only
- The calendar will automatically update as new shifts are scheduled
- You can sync to either your personal calendar or a shared team calendar

<Info>

For additional shift notifications, you can configure on-call notification preferences in your user settings for up to 24 hours in advance of your shifts.
