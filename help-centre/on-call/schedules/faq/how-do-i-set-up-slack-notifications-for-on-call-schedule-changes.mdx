## Context

Teams often need to notify members when on-call schedules change, including who is coming on/off duty. Setting up automated Slack notifications helps keep everyone informed of these schedule changes.

## Answer

You can configure automated Slack notifications for on-call schedule changes using workflows. Here's how to set it up:

1. Navigate to Workflows and create a new workflow
2. Select "An On-call schedule shift changes" as the trigger
3. Add a Slack message action and choose your destination channel
4. In the message, you can use these variables to display shift information:
  - "Previously on-call users" - Shows who was on call
  - "Currently on-call users" - Shows who is now on call

<Info>

Important notes:

- The workflow triggers only when shifts change hands between users, not when shifts start or end with no handover
- Individual users can set up personal notifications through User Preferences for shift notifications
