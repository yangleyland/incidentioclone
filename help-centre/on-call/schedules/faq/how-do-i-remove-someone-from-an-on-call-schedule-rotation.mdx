## Context

When managing on-call schedules, you may need to remove team members from a rotation due to role changes, departures, or schedule adjustments. It's important to understand how these changes affect the existing rotation and upcoming shifts.

## Answer

When removing someone from an on-call schedule, you have two options for managing the transition:

## Option 1: Defer Changes

If you want to avoid disrupting the current rotation:

1. Edit the schedule rotation
2. Remove the team member from the rotation
3. When prompted, select "Defer Changes"
4. Choose when you want the changes to take effect

## Important Notes

- After making changes, check the "This rotation has upcoming changes" section to review and edit any scheduled changes
- Verify the upcoming shifts to ensure the rotation order is as expected
- If you need to make adjustments to when the changes take effect, you can modify the "effective from" date

## Option 2: Change handover time

If you want the changes to take effect now, you can change the handover time of the schedule. We use handover time for our rotation calculations.

1. Edit the schedule rotation
2. Remove the team member from the rotation
3. Change the handover time forward a week to compensate for the user being removed.
4. Check the order is still the same, as you would expect.

Best Practice: Always review the upcoming schedule changes before finalizing them to ensure the rotation sequence meets your team's needs.
