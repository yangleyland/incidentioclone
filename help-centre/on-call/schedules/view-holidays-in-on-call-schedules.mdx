We now let you integrate with external systems as well as subscribe to countries' public holidays so that you can view your team's holidays in your On-call schedules.

This lets you see whether cover might be required for certain On-call shifts at a glance, and easily create overrides from those holidays.

## People holidays / time-off / vacation / PTO

To get started with bringing your team's personal holidays into incident.io, you'll need to have a URL to the calendar feed that contains your team's holiday. We provide tips on how some popular HRIS let you set up calendar feed subscriptions [below](/help-centre/on-call/schedules/view-holidays-in-on-call-schedules)
![](/images/help-centre/view-holidays-in-on-call-schedules/screenshot-1.png)

1. Head to **Settings > Integrations** and select [Calendar feeds](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations/calendar_feeds)

2. Click **Add calendar feed** and enter the URL of the calendar feed you've generated in your HRIS or calendar system, and a name for the feed.

3. That's it - your calendar feed is parsed and ready to be used within schedules! If we find an holiday that matches a responder on your schedule, we'll surface that event in the timeline view.

We will best-effort match users to holiday events using name heuristics or the attendees of the event. If you are not seeing a holiday alongside your On-call schedule as expected, please [let us know](mailto:support@incident.io) and we'll take a look!

## Public holidays / bank holidays

Alongside people's PTO, we also let you subscribe to one or multiple countries' public holidays per schedule. This is done per schedule as On-call schedules are often configured per team, which might work in different regions of the work.

To make this set up as simple as possible for you, when you create or edit a schedule we'll automatically suggest public holiday subscriptions based on the schedule's timezone!

To subscribe to public holidays:

1. Head to your [Schedules](https://app.incident.io/~/on-call/schedules) list, and click **New schedule** or click **Edit** on an existing schedule

2. In the **Public holidays** section, click **Add** and search for the country whose holidays you want to subscribe to

3. **Repeat if needed** , and that's it!

## Acting on your team's holidays

Once you've set up some public holiday or calendar feed subscriptions, we'll automatically surface relevant holidays alongside your On-call schedule shifts.

To easily arrange cover, hover over the holiday and click **Create override** !
