When it comes to on-call, being consistent with schedules is important with any team. We do recommend building schedules in incident.io from scratch, but if you have tens of schedules for your teams you can either duplicate or we'll guide you to migrate your current schedules to incident.io.

## Duplicating schedules

To duplicate schedules, just head to your [Schedules](https://app.incident.io/~/on-call/schedules) , click the menu on the right side and find the 'Duplicate' -button in the menu.

## Importing schedules

At the moment we help you to bring schedules over from PagerDuty and OpsGenie.

1. Head to your Schedules and choose 'Import schedules' from the top right.

2. See all your schedules that are available for importing and choose a schedule from the list

3. After choosing schedule we will open it up in our editor where you can review the schedule and then save it
