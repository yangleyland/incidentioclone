When you get started with incident.io On-call, you probably will want to ensure that your teams and the whole of your organisation have set up their notifications correctly so that they are reachable in the event of an issue.

With our Onboarding flow in the mobile app you can have confidence that team members are setting up sensible defaults, but as an admin you might be missing the detail on what everyone is set up with.

With On-call readiness insights you can easily see how many users have onboarded and are set up according to the methods you care about, and you can also review each specific user's notification settings for both high and low urgency notifications.

High urgency notifications require user attention no matter the time of day, whereas low urgency notifications just keep the user informed and can follow a different process.

When responders download the [incident.io mobile app,](https://app.incident.io/qr) they will be walked through an onboarding flow to add sensible defaults.

## Notification configuration trends

You'll be able to track how your users' notification configuration is changing over time. This allows you to follow how your migration is going, e.g. if onboarding sessions are increasing on-call readiness as you'd want.

## Drill down into each user's configuration

You'll also get access to a table of all notification methods by user. This table reports all your users and the notification methods they have set up. You can easily sort by all the available columns and add column-specific filters, e.g. "who is not reachable outside of Slack".

We only show configurations for high urgency notifications by default, but if you click the cog on the top right you'll be able to see low urgency notification configurations as well.

## Filter by escalation path or schedule

For both the charts and the table, you'll also be able to filter which users we show by what Escalation Path or Schedule they're on. This is especially useful if you're migrating one team at a time, or if different teams have different processes in place!
