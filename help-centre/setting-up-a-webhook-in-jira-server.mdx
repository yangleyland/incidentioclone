Registering a webhook in Jira Server means that changes to follow-ups that have been exported to Jira will sync back quickly.

You'll need to be a Global Administrator in Jira to register a webhook.

## 1. Navigate to System → WebHooks

In Jira, use the cog menu in the top-right to enter System settings.

You may need to enter your password to enter 'administrator mode'.

Near the bottom of the left-hand menu, select **WebHooks** under 'Advanced':

Near the top-right, click ' **Create a WebHook** ':

## 2. Configure the destination

**Name** : 'incident.io'

**Status** : Enabled

**URL** : Check [Settings → Integrations → Jira Server](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/integrations/jira_server) to find your webhook URL

**Description** : Leave blank

## 3. Add events

Under 'Issue related events', check 'issue created', 'issue updated', 'issue deleted', 'issue link created' and 'issue link deleted'.

All other events can be left disabled.

If you configure a JQL filter here, incident.io will only be able to sync updates to issues matching that filter.

## 4. Create the webhook

At the bottom of the page, ensure ' **Exclude body** ' is **not** checked, and click ' **Create** '.

## You're all set up!

If your Jira Server is behind a firewall, you'll need to ensure that the firewall allows outbound traffic to `app.incident.io` . Please contact your customer success manager if we can help with this.
